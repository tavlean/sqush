// An LRU cache of finished encode results, keyed by the exact signature of the
// inputs that produced them (the same signature `encodeSide` already computes).
//
// Why this exists: re-encoding is expensive (seconds for AVIF/JXL on big images).
// When the user steps back through undo/redo — or just toggles a setting and
// reverts it — the result for those settings was already computed once. Keeping it
// lets us show it INSTANTLY instead of re-running the pipeline. This is the
// "return to a previous optimized snapshot" half of the undo feature.
//
// Not reactive on purpose: a `CompressOutcome` holds heavy browser host objects
// (two `ImageData` buffers, a `File`, and a revocable object URL) that must stay
// out of Svelte's reactive graph — the same reason `EditorSession.results` is
// `$state.raw`. This is a plain class; the session pushes hits into its reactive
// `results` field.
//
// Memory: each entry pins two `ImageData` buffers alive, so a count cap alone
// isn't enough — one 24-megapixel image dwarfs a dozen thumbnails. We bound by
// total estimated bytes (with a count cap as a backstop) and evict
// least-recently-used entries, revoking their object URLs as they go. Entries the
// editor is currently displaying are pinned and never evicted.
