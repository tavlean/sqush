# Maintenance status

Last updated: 2026-05-26.

> Historical record. This file predates the root SvelteKit cutover and keeps the

## Resume handoff

Current stable branch: `main`.

Prototype evidence branch: `code/sveltekit-prototype`.

Current SvelteKit migration-seams review branch:
`code/sveltekit-migration-seams`.

Standalone GitHub repo: `tavlean/presk`.

Default branch: `main`.

Project homepage metadata: `https://presk.app`.

Historical archived fork, not the current project: `tavlean/SquooshPlus`.

Project identity note: see [Project identity](../project-identity.md). The current app/repo/package name is Presk. The local checkout has been renamed to `/Users/tav/Development/Tavlean/Presk`. Any remaining `SquooshPlus` references should be historical fork references or temporary tool compatibility paths.

Current local checkout: `/Users/tav/Development/Tavlean/Presk`.

For SvelteKit prototype evidence, read
`docs/sveltekit-prototype-handoff.md`. For the current reusable seam review,
start from `code/sveltekit-migration-seams` and read
`docs/sveltekit-migration-seams-review.md` plus
`docs/sveltekit-migration-seams-exit-audit.md`.

Codec roadmap note: focus WebP first, AVIF second, and JPEG XL as the advanced
codec. WebP 2 is now kept as experimental parity in the SvelteKit editor so the
migration does not silently drop an inherited format. Any future WebP 2
promotion, hiding, or removal should be a separate evidence-based cleanup
decision after the focused codec surface is stable.

Working tree at last update: `code/sveltekit-migration-seams` packages the
SvelteKit prototype findings into reusable seams while keeping the current
Preact app shell intact. Proven shared seams include generated UI-free feature
metadata entrypoints, shared image-pipeline helpers, the production
`imagePipeline` bundle, structural worker-bridge boundaries, service-worker
registration/cache-planning seams, canonical codec asset record helpers,
generated active worker/cache metadata, and prototype evidence for
`processBulkImageJob` plus `runCompressionUpdateWorkflow` through SvelteKit
worker bridges. The branch also records source-safe merge slices in
`docs/sveltekit-migration-seams-review.md` and a roadmap-level exit audit in
`docs/sveltekit-migration-seams-exit-audit.md`. Root `npm run check` and the
prototype gates have passed on the latest meaningful checkpoints. PR #1 is
clean against `main`, and GitHub Actions passed on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS
for the latest migration-seams head. Run `git status --short --branch` for the
exact state.

Next recommended tasks when work resumes:

1. Start the next Codex session from the real project folder `/Users/tav/Development/Tavlean/Presk` if possible. Use this document, the progress dashboard and its visual counterpart (both since deleted), [Todo](todo.md), and [Svelte migration context](svelte-migration-context.md) as handoff context.
2. Continue extracting/tested framework-neutral logic from Preact components where it clearly reduces future Svelte migration risk.
3. Use [Svelte migration context](svelte-migration-context.md) before Svelte-adjacent refactors so new helpers stay aligned with Svelte 5/SvelteKit best practices.
4. Add browser smoke tests before significant UI or codec-surface changes.
5. Do not implement bulk UI until the workflow design has been discussed and iterated.
6. Use `docs/dependency-modernization.md` for dependency cleanup order; do not use `npm audit fix --force` blindly.
7. For live status viewing, run `npm run dashboard` and open the printed `http://localhost:4177` URL. The dashboard reloads only when `docs/progress-dashboard.html` changes.

Quick investigation note:

- `rg "as any|: any| any[),;]" src/client/lazy-app src/features lib/test-helpers.js` currently reports no remaining matches in the main lazy app, feature code, or helper tests. The only generated `as any` text found is emitted by `lib/feature-plugin.js` for worker exposure.

## Completed baseline cleanup

- Added project documentation and a road map.
- Added an issue-list backlog seed.
- Added a progress dashboard to keep cleanup, simplification, bulk, and Svelte migration readiness aligned.

- Added an initial browser support policy note.
- Documented first public browser support targets and release gates for local/offline optimization reliability.
- Added `npm run typecheck`.
- Added `npm test` as an alias for the full baseline check.
- Added `npm run test:unit` as an alias for pure-helper tests.
- Added Node and npm engine metadata matching `.nvmrc`.
- Updated Node type definitions to the newest release compatible with the current TypeScript 4.9 toolchain while moving the runtime baseline to Node 24.
- Added `npm run format` and `npm run format:check`.
- Added `npm run smoke:build` to verify generated build output.
- Expanded `npm run smoke:build` to check generated Presk metadata and absence of analytics code.
- Expanded `npm run smoke:build` to verify generated feature metadata and worker entry files exist.
- Expanded `npm run smoke:build` to guard against accidental external runtime scripts, runtime links, and manifest media.
- Expanded `npm run smoke:build` to verify service-worker precache assets exist in the production build.

- Documented and verified a Playwright CLI smoke flow for the production app shell and local-image editor import path.
- Documented and verified a Playwright CLI smoke flow for explicit WebP output generation and export-link presence.
- Added `npm run smoke:browser` to automate the local production-build Playwright CLI smoke without adding Playwright as a project dependency.
- Expanded `npm run smoke:browser` to verify the real editor writes versioned WebP side settings to `localStorage`.
- Updated CI to use current checkout/setup-node actions and run the baseline checks.
- Expanded CI to cover Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS.
- CI matrix fail-fast is disabled so one platform failure does not hide the other platform results.
- CI uses read-only repository permissions, a 15-minute job timeout, and concurrency cancellation so superseded runs do not keep running after newer pushes.
- Removed the inherited upstream Google Analytics integration.
- Refreshed Browserslist data.
- Removed the old Node `DEP0190` warning from the TypeScript build spawn.
- Upgraded the local static server from `serve@11` to `serve@14`.

- Centralized saved-settings storage reads/writes and fixed the right-side settings event listener cleanup path.
- Modernized one editor media query listener path.
- Hardened the shared abort helper so it removes abort listeners when wrapped work settles.

- Replaced the core image compression pipeline's encoder options cast with typed encoder dispatch.
- Replaced the editor encoder options render cast with typed encoder option component dispatch.
- Replaced avoidable `any` casts in the result cache processor-state comparison.
- Added result-cache helper coverage for matching, mismatched image data, mismatched encoder options, and mismatched processor options.
- Added MIME sniffing helper coverage for PNG, JPEG, WebP, JPEG XL, and unknown data.
- Tightened TIFF MIME sniffing to require real little-endian or big-endian TIFF headers instead of loose `I`/`MM` prefixes.
- Relaxed AVIF MIME sniffing to accept normal `ftypavif` headers regardless of box size while still rejecting non-AVIF `ftyp` data.
- Added an async bulk import helper that can accept extensionless or misnamed image files through injected MIME sniffing.
- Hardened async bulk import MIME sniffing so one unreadable file is rejected without aborting the whole batch.
- Hardened the bulk runner so empty runnable sets are no-ops and do not require worker bridge availability.
- Added explicit bulk runner coverage for zero-concurrency no-op scheduling.
- Hardened bulk export filename sanitization so Windows reserved device names such as `CON` and `LPT1` are not emitted directly.
- Added an `exported` count to bulk export summaries so exported jobs are not reported as pending.
- Replaced avoidable `any` usage and optional Promise entries in service-worker cache cleanup and shared ref utilities.
- Added framework-neutral bulk settings, session, import, queue, and stale-output helpers.
- Hardened bulk session construction so initial active and exported jobs derive matching counters.
- Hardened bulk session job additions so active and exported counters update when adding restored jobs.
- Extracted and tested processor-state equivalence logic from the Preact editor component.
- Tightened bulk override detection so empty nested override objects are not treated as real overrides.
- Tightened bulk session updates so empty per-image override objects are stored as no override.
- Added framework-neutral bulk override summary helpers for future image-strip indicators.
- Added framework-neutral bulk next/previous selection helpers for future image-strip navigation.
- Added framework-neutral bulk selected-job context for future image-strip navigation state.
- Added framework-neutral bulk job effective-settings lookup to keep global/override merge rules out of UI code.
- Added framework-neutral bulk job status grouping for future status labels and controls.
- Added framework-neutral bulk action-state selectors for future export/retry/activity controls.
- Tightened bulk settings merging so falsy overrides such as `false` and `0` remain valid per-image overrides.
- Added a settings override path helper for future per-image override highlighting.
- Hardened bulk queue transitions so missing or repeated jobs do not corrupt active-job counts.
- Hardened bulk queue scheduling so invalid, fractional, negative, or infinite concurrency values do not produce surprising runnable-job lists.
- Hardened bulk queue/session bookkeeping so removed or stale exported jobs keep exported counts consistent.
- Hardened bulk queue completion/failure transitions so exported-count bookkeeping recovers if an exported job is overwritten.
- Hardened bulk queue failure transitions so failed jobs do not retain stale output download data.
- Hardened bulk retry transitions so failed or skipped jobs do not retain stale output download data.
- Hardened bulk single-job requeue bookkeeping so reprocessing an exported job decrements exported counts.
- Added a bulk queue retry helper for failed and skipped jobs.
- Added framework-neutral bulk export helpers for exportable jobs and batch size summaries.
- Added a framework-neutral bulk output summary helper for valid optimized bytes, stale outputs, and already-exported jobs.
- Added a framework-neutral bulk per-job size summary helper so future image-strip stats can ignore stale outputs consistently.
- Added a shared bulk percent-change helper used by processing and summary code.
- Added bulk export entry naming helpers for duplicate-safe future batch downloads.
- Hardened bulk export entry naming so names generated to resolve earlier collisions are also reserved against later files.
- Hardened bulk export archive names so batch IDs cannot create path-like or invalid download names.
- Hardened bulk export filenames for invalid characters, punctuation-only names, hidden-style names, and deterministic case-insensitive duplicate checks.
- Added session helpers for global setting changes and per-image override changes.
- Added detailed bulk progress counters for future batch status displays.
- Hardened bulk session imports so repeated files receive unique job IDs.
- Added a bulk import extension fallback for image files with missing MIME types.
- Expanded bulk import extension fallback to accept extension-only JFIF, BMP, TIFF, and TIF files.
- Added a bulk import summary helper for accepted/rejected counts and byte totals.
- Added a session helper to remove jobs while preserving valid selection and active-job counts.
- Added a session helper to mark encoded jobs exported without double-counting repeat exports.
- Added a lightweight Node assertion test for bulk helper behavior.
- Expanded the lightweight helper test to cover `clean-modify` and `pretty-bytes`.
- Extracted single-image decode/process/encode/SVG pipeline helpers into `src/client/lazy-app/image-pipeline.ts`.
- Added `src/client/lazy-app/bulk/processor.ts` to process one bulk image job through the shared image pipeline without UI coupling.
- Guarded bulk processor percent-change calculation for zero-byte inputs.
- Added `src/client/lazy-app/bulk/runner.ts` to process queued bulk jobs up to the concurrency limit.
- Hardened the bulk runner so already-aborted batches do not start jobs or call processors.
- Added `src/client/lazy-app/bulk/urls.ts` to collect and revoke bulk preview, thumbnail, and download object URLs.
- Hardened bulk object URL cleanup so duplicate preview, thumbnail, and download URLs are only revoked once.
- Fixed SVG `viewBox` size parsing for comma-separated values using a tested helper.
- Replaced POSIX-only `dev` and `serve` script syntax with Node wrappers for better Windows compatibility.
- Documented the full current upstream open PR audit in `docs/upstream-pr-notes.md`.
- Removed duplicate buffer collection in `lib/url-plugin.js` based on upstream PR `#1457`.
- Added UTF-8 charset metadata based on upstream PR `#1072`.
- Added codec provenance inventory and rebuild cautions.
- Added `docs/manual-qa.md`.
- Added `npm run audit` and CI audit enforcement.
- Removed the noisy Rollup unused external import warning by narrowing `path` imports in build plugins.
- Refreshed low-risk dependencies while keeping Preact pinned because the newer Preact 10 typings require a separate migration.
- Refreshed `preact-render-to-string` within major 5 for static prerendering without starting the Preact migration.
- Refreshed compatible Rollup 2 plugins and set `@rollup/plugin-replace` `preventAssignment` explicitly.
- Applied the non-force `npm audit fix` lockfile update for `brace-expansion`.
- Migrated the CSS build stack to PostCSS 8-era packages.
- Upgraded `@rollup/plugin-terser` to clear the remaining serialization audit findings.

## Current verification commands

Run these before committing substantial changes:

```sh
npm run format:check
npm run build
npm run smoke:build
npm run test:helpers
npm run typecheck
```

For UI-sensitive changes, also run a browser smoke check against `build/` after `npm run build`.
Use `npm run preview` for that production-build browser check; `npm run serve` is for dev output in `.tmp/build/static`.

On a fresh checkout, run `npm run build` before `npm run typecheck` because the build creates ignored feature metadata files required by TypeScript. `npm run check` already runs commands in the safe order and includes the helper tests.

## Remaining audit state

`npm audit --audit-level=low` currently reports 0 vulnerabilities.

Keep avoiding blind `npm audit fix --force`; future findings should still be handled as explicit dependency or toolchain tasks with verification.

## Local npm cache issue

The default npm cache at `/Users/tav/.npm` previously failed with `EPERM` in this environment. The manual ownership repair was run successfully:

```sh
sudo chown -R 501:20 "/Users/tav/.npm"
npm cache verify
```

`npm cache verify` now succeeds in the user's normal terminal. The Codex sandbox may still report `EPERM` against individual cache files, so use a temporary npm cache for Codex-run install/update commands if that reappears.
