# SvelteKit prototype handoff

Last updated: 2026-05-26.

## Purpose

Create a small, disposable technical prototype that answers whether Presk can
move from the current Rollup/Preact stack toward SvelteKit without weakening the
core product promise:

- image optimization stays local;
- no server upload path is introduced;
- offline/service-worker behavior remains viable;
- workers and WASM assets can be built and served reliably;
- existing framework-neutral helpers can be reused from a SvelteKit app.

This is not a production UI migration and not the bulk UI implementation.

## Recommended branch/worktree

Use Codex Desktop's **New Worktree** option from the existing
`code/sveltekit-prototype` branch. Keep `main` stable. The prototype branch may
add temporary dependencies, configuration, and scaffolding that would be too
noisy for the production app until proven.

## Prototype scope

Start with `prototypes/sveltekit/`.

The first milestone should prove:

1. Svelte 5/SvelteKit static output builds.
2. A Svelte route can import existing plain TypeScript helpers from the repo.
3. Bulk/session helpers can create and summarize a metadata-only batch.
4. The prototype can include a service-worker path or document what blocks it.
5. The prototype can explain how current worker/WASM codec assets would be
   handled before any real migration.

Use SvelteKit as the target. Do not broaden the spike to any non-SvelteKit
build path unless SvelteKit produces a concrete blocker that is documented with
a minimal reproduction.

Important SvelteKit/Svelte 5 guidance for this spike:

- Prefer `@sveltejs/adapter-static` and static output.
- Use SvelteKit's service-worker support and `$service-worker` manifest for
  built assets, static files, prerendered paths, and versioned cache names.
- Use `$app/environment` for browser/dev/build-time checks when needed.
- Keep browser-only APIs behind browser-only execution paths.
- Use Svelte 5 runes: `$state` for local mutable UI state, `$derived` for pure
  computed values, `$effect` only for real side effects, and `$props` for
  component inputs.
- Avoid `$effect` for state relationships that can be derived.
- Keep large binary payloads such as `File`, `Blob`, `ImageData`, workers, WASM
  modules, and object URLs out of deep reactive state unless there is a measured
  reason.
- Use keyed `{#each}` blocks for image jobs and stable job identity.
- Use `svelte-check` and the Svelte MCP autofixer before finalizing Svelte files.

Avoid:

- production bulk UI;
- replacing the current app shell;
- deleting or moving codecs;
- changing current Rollup build behavior;
- adding server-side image processing.

## Current recommendation

The SvelteKit prototype is now the active engineering spike. It should answer
the build/platform question before production migration work begins.

If it succeeds, merge back lessons and small reusable config/docs first. Do not
merge a full UI rewrite by default.

## Autonomous next-task queue

Use this queue when continuing the prototype for longer autonomous runs. Work in
order, keep each checkpoint meaningful, and stop only when a task is proven,
blocked with a concrete reproduction, or a safer next task is clearly documented.

### 1. WebP single-image pipeline probe

Status: proven for a narrow WebP path.

The prototype now has a diagnostic SvelteKit path that starts from a locally
generated PNG `File`, uses existing local helper primitives for encode-to-source,
mime sniffing, browser decode, resize processing, output naming, percent change,
settings resolution, and settings hashing, then encodes through the existing
WebP worker module in a SvelteKit-built worker. Runtime browser verification
produced a real `RIFF`/`WEBP` output and export metadata.

Do not treat this as proof that the full current app shell is drop-in.
`src/client/lazy-app/image-pipeline.ts` now delegates decode, preprocess,
process, SVG handling, and generic encoder wrapping to
`src/client/lazy-app/image-pipeline-shared.ts`, then adds only the production
encoder-map dispatch. That shared implementation has a proven WebP prototype
path through the generated SvelteKit worker bridge and encode-only metadata map.
`bulk/processor.ts` now has a proven WebP prototype path through production
`processBulkImageJob` using the same structural worker-bridge type. The wider
app surface still crosses production worker, UI option, and Rollup-only virtual
import boundaries. The next task should keep turning those remaining boundaries
into reusable migration seams instead of broadening the prototype into
production UI.

### 2. Reusable migration seams

Status: started.

The first behavior-preserving shared-source seam is in place:
`src/client/lazy-app/abort.ts` owns abort helpers, and
`src/client/lazy-app/image-decode.ts` owns browser decode/mime helpers. The broad
`util` module keeps re-exports for compatibility, production image-pipeline code
imports the narrow modules directly, and the SvelteKit prototype no longer needs
to import browser decode helpers through `util`.

If the pipeline probe needs tiny shared helpers, extract them from Preact code
only when the change is behavior-preserving and covered by checks. Prefer
framework-neutral helper modules over Svelte-specific or Preact-specific glue.
Do not broaden into production UI work.

The next seam is now partially proven for encoding: generated
`feature-meta/encoders` combines shared encoder metadata with runtime-only
encoder modules, while the existing generated `feature-meta` index keeps the
Preact option entries. `src/client/lazy-app/image-pipeline.ts` imports that
encode-only map, re-exports the shared decode/preprocess/process
implementation, and no longer imports the production Rollup `omt:` worker entry
for its worker type. The SvelteKit prototype imports the production
`decodeSourceImage`, `preprocessImage`, `processImage`, and `compressImage`
helpers for its WebP probe without importing Preact option components.
`src/client/lazy-app/bulk/processor.ts` now uses that same structural
`ImagePipelineWorkerBridge` type, so the SvelteKit prototype can import and run
production `processBulkImageJob` without importing the production Rollup worker
adapter.
Generated `feature-meta/processors` and `feature-meta/preprocessors` now expose
framework-neutral processor/preprocessor metadata maps and defaults without
importing Preact option components. Generated UI option entries for processors
and preprocessors remain a later split if SvelteKit needs generated controls.

### 3. Prototype offline proof

Status: proven for the prototype shell, WebP probe assets, and the first
generated rotate WASM seam.

The prototype registers its emitted `service-worker.js` in production builds.
The static audit now confirms cache-manifest coverage for app entry/start/route
assets, page CSS, service-worker-imported codec workers, baseline WebP WASM,
SIMD WebP WASM, and emitted rotate WASM. Runtime Chrome verification confirmed
the page becomes service-worker controlled after reload and Cache Storage
contains the app shell, generated WebP features-worker, baseline WebP WASM, SIMD
WebP WASM, top-level rotate WASM, and the worker-local rotate WASM fetched by the
generated worker.

One important finding: SvelteKit's build manifest and the explicit codec asset
manifest can both contain the same WebP WASM URLs. Passing duplicates to
`cache.addAll` makes the service-worker install fail and the worker become
redundant, so the prototype de-dupes the install list with `Set`.

Extend `audit:static-output` and browser checks as new codec surfaces are added.
If the available browser surface cannot expose service workers, document that
limitation and add the strongest static/runtime proxy check available.

### 4. Codec asset duplication

Status: documented blocker.

Static output currently emits three baseline WebP WASM files and three SIMD
WebP WASM files:

- top-level SvelteKit assets from the app's explicit WebP asset probe import;
- app-worker-local assets from the app's Emscripten encoder worker graph;
- service-worker-worker-local assets from importing worker URLs in the
  service-worker graph.

Removing explicit WebP WASM URLs from `codecAssetUrls` avoids duplicate
`cache.addAll` install-list entries while keeping top-level WebP WASM covered by
SvelteKit's build manifest. The prototype now passes those top-level WASM URLs
from the app module into the WebP probe workers and exposes them through an
Emscripten `locateFile` hook before initializing the encoder module. Runtime
Chrome verification showed the controlled page still encodes WebP, Cache Storage
contains the top-level baseline and SIMD WASM assets, and no worker-local WASM
URLs are runtime-cached.

This does not remove physical duplicates, because the Emscripten-generated WebP
JS still contains `new URL("webp_enc*.wasm", import.meta.url)` references, and
Vite emits those assets separately for each worker graph.

Production migration implication: make codec JS and service-worker manifests
share one generated asset URL per WASM file, or patch/regenerate codec wrappers
so WASM URLs are externalized instead of embedded as worker-local
`new URL(..., import.meta.url)` references.

For tiny WASM files, Vite's default asset inlining can hide a codec asset inside
the JS bundle. The prototype now disables WASM inlining so emitted files and
service-worker coverage remain visible. It also keeps service-worker codec
assets in a narrow module that avoids importing the generated rotate manifest
from the service-worker graph; the app's SvelteKit build manifest already
pre-caches the top-level rotate WASM, and runtime caching covers the worker-local
rotate WASM after first use.

### 5. Readiness verdict

Status: ready for a platform decision.

Verdict: SvelteKit static output can safely carry Presk's local-first
single-image optimizer architecture if the migration is done as a build/runtime
port with explicit seams, not as a direct app-shell import. The prototype proves
the important platform pieces: static output, Svelte 5 state, shared bulk/session
helper imports, generated WebP shared metadata, browser-only image helper reuse,
Vite module workers, real WebP WASM encoding, service-worker registration,
offline cache coverage for the app shell and WebP probe assets, and runtime
`locateFile` control over which WebP WASM URLs are cached.

This is not yet production-migration-ready. The WebP single-image helper path in
the production image pipeline is now importable from SvelteKit, including
decode, preprocess, process, and compression. The WebP bulk job processor path
is also importable through production `processBulkImageJob`. A broader direct
app import is still blocked by remaining production Rollup virtual imports
(`omt:`, broader `url:`, `entry-data:`, `service-worker:`), UI option entries
outside that seam, and Emscripten codec wrappers that embed worker-local WASM
asset URLs. The rotate seam proves the likely `url:` replacement shape for a
small WASM preprocessor: split the production Rollup adapter from a reusable
runtime that accepts a generated Vite `?url` asset. Those are concrete migration
tasks, not evidence that SvelteKit static output is the wrong target.

Safest next engineering track:

1. Split generated codec metadata into framework-neutral shared metadata and UI
   option entries.
2. Replace Rollup virtual imports with Vite/SvelteKit-compatible worker, URL,
   entry-data, and service-worker asset seams.
3. Externalize or generate canonical codec WASM asset URLs so app code,
   workers, and service-worker manifests agree on one runtime URL per WASM file.
4. Only after those seams exist, build a minimal SvelteKit single-image editor
   slice around real user-selected files and compare import, decode, process,
   encode, preview, export, and offline behavior against the current Preact app.

Migration-seams progress on `code/sveltekit-migration-seams`:

- The production `feature-plugin` now emits
  `src/client/lazy-app/feature-meta/shared.ts` as a generated shared-only
  metadata module. It contains encoder metadata, encoder/processor/preprocessor
  state types, default processor state, and default preprocessor state without
  importing encoder client entries or Preact option components.
- The existing generated `feature-meta/index.ts` remains the compatibility layer
  for the Preact app shell. It re-exports shared types/defaults and builds the
  full encoder map by adding the existing encoder client entries.
- The production `feature-plugin` also emits
  `src/client/lazy-app/worker-bridge/surface.ts` as an ignored generated
  worker-surface inventory. It lists active worker methods separately from
  methods that still need explicit codec asset, thread-support, or type proof.
  It now also emits ignored
  `src/features-worker/active.ts`, a Comlink worker entry for the active method
  set, plus
  `src/client/lazy-app/worker-bridge/active-meta.ts` for the matching active
  bridge method names/types. The existing production `features-worker/index.ts`
  stays the full Rollup/Preact worker entry for current app behavior.
- Pure or mostly framework-neutral production helpers that only need metadata
  now import from `feature-meta/shared`, including bulk settings/processor
  helpers and saved-settings/side-state/work-plan/editor-state helpers.
- Pure compression workflow helpers that only need generated metadata types now
  import from `feature-meta/shared` as well, including source/side workflow,
  render-state, result-cache, processor-state, and output/option control-state
  helpers. The remaining plain `.ts` production import from the full
  `feature-meta` index is `Options/encoder-support.ts`, which intentionally
  needs runtime encoder client entries such as `featureTest`.
- The SvelteKit prototype generator now mirrors that path shape by emitting
  `feature-meta/shared.ts` and `feature-meta/index.ts` files under
  `.svelte-kit/presk-generated/`. The current SvelteKit branch includes the
  inherited single-image codec surface, with WebP 2 kept as experimental parity
  rather than a primary product promise.
- The production rotate preprocessor worker now has a reusable runtime factory
  that accepts a WASM URL, while the production `rotate.ts` remains the Rollup
  `url:` adapter. The SvelteKit prototype generator emits a Vite `?url` rotate
  WASM manifest and passes that canonical URL through the generated worker
  bridge instead of importing a second worker-local URL.
- The prototype pipeline now exercises that generated worker `rotate` method
  before resize/WebP encode. Runtime Chrome verification produced valid
  `RIFF`/`WEBP` output with the `rotate=90` stage visible and Cache Storage
  covering the canonical rotate WASM.
- `src/sw/cache-plan.ts` now owns the framework-neutral service-worker cache
  planning logic for Rollup `entry-data:` records shaped as `{ main, deps }`.
  Production `src/sw/to-cache.ts` still imports Rollup virtual modules at the
  boundary, but initial-cache and feature-detected codec-cache selection now run
  through a reusable helper with focused tests. The shared cache planner now
  also exposes active codec-cache helpers for migration work while keeping the
  full current production cache path intact.
- `src/sw/processor-support.ts` now owns the shared service-worker support probe
  for threads, SIMD, WebP, and AVIF detection, so the full and active cache
  boundaries do not drift.
- `src/sw/active-to-cache.ts` mirrors the production Rollup `entry-data:`
  boundary against `features-worker/active` and the active cache planner. It is
  not wired to the current service worker.
- The SvelteKit prototype generator now emits
  `.svelte-kit/presk-generated/service-worker/cache-plan.ts`, which mirrors the
  same `{ main, deps }` shape with Vite worker URLs and generated WebP WASM URL
  deps. The prototype service-worker asset list consumes that generated plan,
  proving the first replacement shape for production `entry-data:` cache
  records without changing current production offline behavior.
- `src/client/lazy-app/sw-bridge/runtime.ts` now owns the framework-neutral
  service-worker registration/update/share-target bridge. Production
  `src/client/lazy-app/sw-bridge/index.ts` keeps the Rollup `service-worker:`
  URL import as a tiny adapter, while the SvelteKit prototype calls the same
  registration helper with its emitted `/service-worker.js` URL from
  `prototypes/sveltekit/src/lib/service-worker-registration.ts`.

Next seam: broaden the generated Vite-facing worker/cache surface only as each
codec's URL, thread-support, and type blockers are resolved. The remaining
Rollup virtual assumptions are now smaller: non-WebP `url:` codec assets,
thread-support aliases, and production codec wrappers that still embed
worker-local WASM URLs.

Worker-bridge seam progress:

- `src/client/lazy-app/worker-bridge/runtime.ts` now owns the reusable Comlink
  bridge runtime and accepts explicit method names plus a `createWorker`
  function.
- `src/client/lazy-app/worker-bridge/bridge.ts` adapts that runtime to the
  production generated `methodNames` list.
- `src/client/lazy-app/worker-bridge/active-bridge.ts` adapts the same runtime
  to the generated active method list from `worker-bridge/active-meta.ts`
  without changing the current production adapter.
- `src/client/lazy-app/worker-bridge/index.ts` is now the Rollup adapter that
  imports the current `omt:` worker URL and passes `() => new Worker(workerURL)`
  into the shared bridge factory.
- `src/client/lazy-app/worker-bridge/active-index.ts` mirrors that adapter shape
  for `omt:../../../features-worker/active`, but it is not used by the current
  app shell.
- Root `npm run check` and `npm run smoke:browser` passed after the split,
  including real WebP output, resize processing, saved-settings import, and
  offline app-shell reload.
- The SvelteKit prototype now has a WebP-only Vite adapter at
  `prototypes/sveltekit/src/lib/sveltekit-worker-bridge.ts`. It uses
  generated SvelteKit worker metadata and a generated WebP-first module worker
  URL, and the WebP pipeline probe now encodes through that shared bridge
  runtime instead of a bespoke or handwritten worker entry.
- Runtime Chrome verification confirmed the controlled SvelteKit page still
  renders the bridge-factory WebP pipeline probe with `RIFF`/`WEBP`, caches the
  app shell and top-level baseline/SIMD WebP WASM assets, and does not add
  worker-local WASM URLs to Cache Storage.
- `src/features/encoders/webP/client/runtime.ts` and
  `src/features/processors/resize/client/runtime.ts` now expose the WebP encode
  and resize runtime helpers without importing Preact option controls.
- `src/client/lazy-app/image-pipeline.ts` now provides a SvelteKit-importable
  single-image helper surface by re-exporting the shared decode, preprocess,
  process, SVG, and generic encoder wrapper implementation, then adding the
  production encoder-map dispatch for WebP compression. The SvelteKit probe
  calls those production helpers through the generated encode-only
  metadata/runtime map plus the SvelteKit worker bridge.
- `src/client/lazy-app/bulk/processor.ts` now takes the structural
  `ImagePipelineWorkerBridge` type instead of the production Rollup worker
  adapter type. The SvelteKit probe imports production `processBulkImageJob` and
  completes a WebP bulk job with an injected download URL creator.
- `src/client/lazy-app/Compress/update-workflow.ts` is now imported by the
  SvelteKit probe and completes the WebP side of the production compression
  update workflow with injected state patching, `ResultCache`, generated
  SvelteKit worker bridges, and the production `imagePipeline` helper bundle.
  This proves the workflow orchestration seam is usable outside the Preact
  component shell.
- The SvelteKit prototype sync step now emits
  `.svelte-kit/presk-generated/codec-assets/webp.ts` as the canonical WebP
  encoder WASM URL manifest. The service-worker asset list and
  `SvelteKitWorkerBridge` both consume those generated URLs, so the app, worker
  bridge, and cache manifest agree on the top-level WebP WASM asset URLs.
- The prototype sync step now emits
  `.svelte-kit/presk-generated/codec-assets/manifest.ts` as the logical asset
  record manifest for all active generated codec WASM URLs. App code,
  `SvelteKitWorkerBridge`, and generated service-worker cache entries derive
  URL lists from that manifest, proving the next canonical asset-manifest shape
  before wrapper-level physical duplication is fixed. The service-worker graph
  imports a generated precache-only manifest, so runtime-only records such as
  rotate do not get inlined into the service-worker install cache.
- The SvelteKit prototype sync step now emits
  `.svelte-kit/presk-generated/worker-surface/ready.ts`. The generated worker
  bridge metadata imports its ready method-name list, and the same file records
  blocked worker methods with their current codec asset, thread-support, or type
  blockers.
- `avifDecode` has moved from blocked to ready in the generated worker-surface
  manifest. The prototype now generates an AVIF decoder WASM URL manifest,
  passes it through the SvelteKit worker bridge, verifies a local AVIF fixture
  decode in the runtime pipeline probe, and audits service-worker cache coverage
  for the AVIF decoder WASM asset. The prototype now imports a generated patched
  AVIF decoder wrapper copy through the shared AVIF decoder runtime seam, so
  static output emits exactly one canonical AVIF decoder WASM asset.
- `avifEncode` has moved from blocked to ready for a forced single-thread
  runtime path in the generated worker-surface manifest. The production AVIF
  worker now keeps its lazy threaded-capable adapter while exposing an
  injectable runtime factory, the prototype generates an AVIF encoder WASM URL
  manifest, verifies AVIF `ftyp` output plus an `avifDecode` round trip in the
  runtime pipeline probe, and audits service-worker cache coverage for the
  single-thread AVIF encoder WASM asset. The prototype imports a generated
  patched single-thread AVIF encoder wrapper copy, so static output emits
  exactly one canonical AVIF encoder WASM asset and no AVIF threaded worker
  helper assets. Threaded production parity remains a separate migration proof.
- `webpDecode` has moved from blocked to ready in the generated worker-surface
  manifest. The prototype now generates the WebP decoder WASM URL alongside the
  WebP encoder WASM URLs, passes it through the SvelteKit worker bridge,
  verifies a 3x3 WebP decode round trip in the runtime pipeline probe, and
  audits service-worker cache coverage for the decoder WASM asset.
- `qoiEncode` and `qoiDecode` have moved from blocked to ready in that generated
  worker-surface manifest. The prototype now generates
  `.svelte-kit/presk-generated/codec-assets/qoi.ts`, passes the QOI encoder and
  decoder WASM URLs through the SvelteKit worker bridge, verifies a `qoif`
  output plus 3x3 QOI decode round trip in the runtime pipeline probe, and
  audits service-worker cache coverage for both QOI WASM assets. The QOI
  encoder and decoder now use injectable runtime factories, and the prototype
  imports generated patched QOI wrapper copies so static output emits exactly
  one canonical QOI encoder WASM asset and one canonical QOI decoder WASM asset.
- `jxlEncode` and `jxlDecode` have moved from blocked to ready for a forced
  single-thread runtime path in the generated worker-surface manifest. The
  production JPEG XL encoder now keeps its lazy threaded-capable adapter while
  exposing an injectable runtime factory, the prototype generates JPEG XL
  encoder and decoder WASM URL manifests, verifies JPEG XL `ff 0a` output plus a
  decode round trip in the runtime pipeline probe, and audits service-worker
  cache coverage for both JPEG XL WASM assets. The prototype imports generated
  patched JPEG XL encoder/decoder wrapper copies through shared JPEG XL runtime
  seams, so static output emits exactly one canonical JPEG XL encoder WASM
  asset, one canonical JPEG XL decoder WASM asset, and no JPEG XL threaded
  worker-helper assets. Threaded production parity remains a separate migration
  proof.
- `mozjpegEncode` has moved from blocked to ready in the generated
  worker-surface manifest. The prototype now generates
  `.svelte-kit/presk-generated/codec-assets/mozjpeg.ts`, passes the MozJPEG
  encoder WASM URL through the SvelteKit worker bridge, verifies JPEG
  `ff d8 ff` output in the runtime pipeline probe, and audits service-worker
  cache coverage for the MozJPEG WASM asset. The MozJPEG encoder now uses an
  injectable runtime factory, and the prototype imports a generated patched
  MozJPEG wrapper copy so static output emits exactly one canonical MozJPEG
  encoder WASM asset. The shared MozJPEG metadata now exposes local numeric
  color-space constants instead of importing a declaration-only codec enum as a
  runtime value.
- `quantize` has moved from blocked to ready in the generated worker-surface
  manifest. The prototype now generates
  `.svelte-kit/presk-generated/codec-assets/imagequant.ts`, passes the
  ImageQuant WASM URL through the SvelteKit worker bridge, verifies a
  reduced-color ImageData result in the runtime pipeline probe, and audits
  service-worker cache coverage for the ImageQuant WASM asset. The quantize
  worker now uses an injectable runtime factory, and the prototype imports a
  generated patched ImageQuant wrapper copy so static output emits exactly one
  canonical ImageQuant WASM asset. The production quantize worker now returns an
  ImageData-compatible `Uint8ClampedArray` instance under stricter SvelteKit
  TypeScript settings.
- Worker `resize` has moved from blocked to ready in the generated
  worker-surface manifest. The prototype now generates
  `.svelte-kit/presk-generated/codec-assets/resize.ts`, passes resize and HQX
  WASM URLs through the SvelteKit worker bridge, verifies a 2x2 ImageData result
  in the runtime pipeline probe, and audits service-worker cache coverage for
  both wasm-bindgen assets. The production resize worker keeps its default
  Rollup-compatible initialization path while accepting optional injected WASM
  URLs for Vite/SvelteKit. The resize worker now uses an injectable runtime
  factory, and the prototype imports generated patched resize/HQX wasm-bindgen
  wrapper copies so static output emits exactly one canonical resize WASM asset
  and one canonical HQX WASM asset.
- `oxipngEncode` has moved from blocked to ready for the single-thread runtime
  path in the generated worker-surface manifest. The prototype now resolves the
  `worker-shared` alias through SvelteKit, generates
  `.svelte-kit/presk-generated/codec-assets/oxipng.ts`, passes the OxiPNG WASM
  URL through the SvelteKit worker bridge, verifies PNG `89 50 4e 47` output in
  the runtime pipeline probe, and audits service-worker cache coverage for the
  single-thread OxiPNG WASM asset. The production OxiPNG worker now keeps its
  lazy threaded-capable adapter while exposing an injectable runtime factory,
  and the prototype imports a generated patched single-thread wasm-bindgen
  wrapper copy so static output emits exactly one canonical OxiPNG WASM asset
  and no parallel OxiPNG worker-helper assets.

Next worker seam: WebP 2 is now included in the SvelteKit prototype only as
experimental parity. Do not spend threaded-runtime or product-positioning effort
on it without maintainer evidence that it is useful. The next valuable work
remains the threaded-runtime strategy for already-relevant codecs, the canonical
codec asset URL strategy, and the merge plan for production-safe seams versus
prototype evidence.

Full worker-surface blocker inventory:

- Importing the production `features-worker` surface directly from SvelteKit
  still pulls every codec worker. The generator now emits
  `src/features-worker/active.ts` and
  `src/client/lazy-app/worker-bridge/active-meta.ts` for the active method set;
  WebP 2 is wired in the SvelteKit prototype separately as experimental parity.
  `worker-bridge/active-bridge.ts` can build a bridge over that generated active
  method list. `worker-bridge/active-index.ts` also proves the
  matching Rollup adapter shape for the active entry. That entry pair is not yet
  wired to a SvelteKit worker adapter and still includes active methods whose
  threaded production runtime needs separate proof. AVIF decode, AVIF encode,
  WebP decode/encode, QOI encode/decode, JPEG XL encode/decode, MozJPEG encode,
  single-thread OxiPNG encode, quantize, worker resize, and rotate now have
  narrow generated SvelteKit paths; the broader production active worker entry
  remains unwired in the prototype until the threaded and canonical asset risks
  are resolved.
- AVIF, JPEG XL, and production-threaded OxiPNG workers still need focused
  threaded-codec passes.
  `worker-shared/supports-wasm-threads` now has a SvelteKit alias shape, but the
  actual threaded WASM runtime still needs COOP/COEP, nested-worker, worker
  helper asset, and service-worker cache proof before those threaded paths can
  be considered production-ready. AVIF and JPEG XL now have proven forced
  single-thread encode/decode asset seams, and OxiPNG now has a proven injected
  single-thread encode path, but those do not prove the threaded runtime.
- WebP 2 is included for experimental parity in the current SvelteKit branch.
  Keep it behind normal codec UI rather than treating it as a primary migration
  blocker, and avoid spending threaded-runtime or product-positioning effort on
  it unless maintainer testing proves it is worth keeping. Production
  `to-cache.ts` still preserves current full cache behavior until any product
  removal becomes a separate cleanup decision.
- Codec asset records now use the shared `src/shared/codec-assets.ts`
  `CodecAssetRecord` contract and precache URL helpers. The prototype generator
  still owns the SvelteKit `?url` imports, but app, worker, and service-worker
  code now agree on a production-source manifest shape instead of a
  prototype-only type.
- Rotate now has a proven split: production keeps the Rollup `url:` adapter,
  while the SvelteKit generated worker imports the shared rotate runtime with a
  generated Vite `?url` asset manifest.
- Resize now has a proven split: production keeps default wasm-bindgen
  initialization, while the SvelteKit generated worker passes resize/HQX WASM
  URLs from a generated Vite `?url` asset manifest.
- The WebP encode and decode workers now have injectable runtime seams.
  Production keeps the default dynamic imports, while the SvelteKit prototype
  passes prototype-generated patched WebP wrapper copies that strip
  Emscripten's worker-local fallback `new URL("webp_*.wasm", import.meta.url)`
  references. Runtime loading still uses generated manifest URLs through
  `locateFile`, and the static-output audit now expects exactly one baseline
  encoder, one SIMD encoder, and one decoder WebP WASM output.
- Importing the production generated `feature-meta/index.ts` from SvelteKit
  still pulls Preact `.tsx` encoder option entries. The production generator now
  emits `feature-meta/encoders.ts` as the SvelteKit-safe encode runtime map, and
  future seams should follow that pattern for any non-UI runtime surface that
  still depends on UI option entries.

Recommended next implementation step: stop broadening the single-thread
worker-method list. The active worker methods now have generated SvelteKit paths
and one canonical physical WASM asset each in static output, with WebP 2 kept as
experimental parity rather than a new product promise. The useful next
checkpoint is to package the migration-seams branch into a source-only review
set, then start a focused threaded-runtime branch or a production codec-asset
generator branch before attempting a minimal SvelteKit editor slice.

### Merge plan

The `code/sveltekit-migration-seams` branch should be reviewed as two different
kinds of work:

- Production-safe seam candidates for `main`: behavior-preserving generated
  metadata splits, runtime helper splits, structural worker-bridge types,
  service-worker cache planning, service-worker registration runtime helpers,
  injected codec WASM URL seams, and narrow codec worker fixes that keep the
  existing Preact/Rollup app behavior intact.
- Prototype-only evidence to keep out of `main` by default:
  `prototypes/sveltekit/`, generated SvelteKit manifests, diagnostic route UI,
  prototype package dependencies, static-output audit scripts, and browser proof
  scaffolding.
- Not ready for `main`: threaded AVIF/JPEG XL/OxiPNG runtime parity, production
  canonical codec worker/WASM asset URL generation, full production
  `features-worker` filtering/import, processor/preprocessor UI option entry
  splits beyond metadata, and any SvelteKit production editor UI.

Merge or cherry-pick production-safe seam candidates into `main` only after root
`npm run check` passes, production smoke coverage remains green where relevant,
and the review confirms the current Preact app still owns production routing and
service-worker behavior. Keep prototype evidence available on the branch as the
reasoning record, but do not merge it unless the maintainer explicitly wants the
prototype tree preserved in `main`.

Use `docs/sveltekit-migration-seams-review.md` as the review inventory. It
lists the production-safe seam candidates, prototype-only evidence, unresolved
follow-up tracks, and verification gates for any source-safe subset. Use
`docs/sveltekit-migration-seams-exit-audit.md` for the roadmap-level status and
next-branch decision.
Use `docs/sveltekit-codec-asset-strategy.md` for the canonical codec
worker/WASM URL plan before starting the codec-asset branch.

### Next branch plan

After the safe seams are reviewed, create the next branch from the best stable
base:

1. If the production-safe seams have landed, branch from updated `main`.
2. If review is still in progress, branch from `code/sveltekit-migration-seams`
   and expect to rebase/cherry-pick once the safe seams land.

Use that next branch for one focused target, not a broad migration:

- `code/sveltekit-threaded-codecs`: prove or document threaded AVIF,
  JPEG XL, and OxiPNG under static SvelteKit output, including COOP/COEP
  requirements, nested workers, helper assets, and service-worker cache coverage.
- `code/sveltekit-codec-assets`: create a canonical codec worker/WASM asset URL
  strategy that removes physical duplication and gives app code, workers, and
  service-worker manifests the same generated URL records.
- `code/sveltekit-single-image-slice`: only after the above risks are clear,
  build a minimal SvelteKit single-image slice with real user-selected files and
  compare import, decode, process, encode, preview, export, and offline behavior
  against the current Preact app. Start with WebP, add AVIF next, keep JPEG XL
  advanced, and keep WebP 2 only as experimental parity until testing says
  otherwise.

### Verification expectations

- In `prototypes/sveltekit`: run `npm run check`, `npm run build`,
  `npm run audit:static-output`, and `npm audit --audit-level=low`.
- Run Svelte MCP autofixer for changed `.svelte` files.
- Run browser/render checks for runtime or service-worker behavior changes.
- Run root `npm run check` when touching shared production source.
- Commit meaningful checkpoints.
- Push when CI feedback is useful and check the CI result.

## Fresh-chat prompt

Use this short goal prompt in a new Codex chat. The goal text is intentionally
compact so it fits Codex Desktop's goal length limit; the detailed context lives
in the files it tells the new agent to read.

```text
Continue Presk's SvelteKit 2 / Svelte 5 technical prototype until it can give a
clear migration-readiness answer for Presk's local-first single-image optimizer.

Use Codex Desktop New Worktree from branch `code/sveltekit-prototype`.

Read first:
- AGENTS.md
- docs/sveltekit-prototype-handoff.md
- docs/phase-1-readiness-audit.md
- docs/svelte-migration-context.md
- docs/bulk-image-architecture.md
- docs/maintenance-status.md
- docs/browser-support.md
- docs/codec-provenance.md
- docs/codec-source-references.md
- prototypes/sveltekit/README.md

Prototype lives in `prototypes/sveltekit/`.

Constraints:
- Keep Presk local/offline/serverless; no uploads or server image processing.
- Keep SvelteKit static output as the target unless there is a concrete blocker
  documented with a minimal reproduction.
- Do not implement production bulk UI.
- Do not start a full production migration.
- Do not replace the current Preact app shell.
- Do not delete/move codecs, generated metadata, workers, or WASM assets.
- Use Svelte MCP/docs when creating, editing, or analyzing Svelte code.
- Keep the prototype disposable and separated under `prototypes/sveltekit`.

Current prototype already proves SvelteKit static output, shared helpers,
generated WebP metadata, Vite workers/WASM, WebP pipeline encoding, and offline
cache coverage. Continue through the "Autonomous next-task queue" in
`docs/sveltekit-prototype-handoff.md`, committing meaningful checkpoints.

Verification: use the handoff's verification expectations. Push when CI feedback
is useful and check the CI result.
