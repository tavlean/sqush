# Svelte migration context

This document records the SvelteKit migration guidance for Presk. It is based on
Svelte MCP documentation passes on 2026-05-24 and 2026-05-25.

Use this as Svelte/SvelteKit guidance, not as the live scope tracker. The
migration is now **concluded** (`main` is the production app); live state is in
[the project brief](../project/brief.md), the concluded migration record is in
[MIGRATION-PLAN.md](MIGRATION-PLAN.md), the active cleanup track is in
[svelte-hardening-plan.md](../svelte-hardening-plan.md), and product work is in
[road-map.md](../project/roadmap.md).

## Main principle

Do not migrate the UI just to migrate it. Presk is valuable because local image optimization works reliably: import, decode, process, encode, preview, export, and offline use must remain dependable.

The Svelte migration should make the app easier to maintain and extend without
weakening the proven single-image optimizer. Bulk image optimization is a
post-migration product milestone and should reuse the same reliable processing
path when roadmap work begins.

## Recommended target

The target is Svelte 5 with SvelteKit 2 using static output. The technical
prototype has been promoted to the repo root on the `svelte` branch; do not
broaden the app to any non-SvelteKit build path unless SvelteKit produces a
concrete blocker that is documented with a minimal reproduction.

SvelteKit is still a good candidate because it supports:

- static site generation with `adapter-static`;
- single-page app output when needed;
- automatic service-worker registration;
- a documented offline app path;
- built-in project structure, testing, and deployment conventions.

For Presk, any SvelteKit setup must stay browser-first and static. Image processing should continue to happen locally in the browser through workers and WASM, not through a server route.

## Migration shape

1. Keep the current Preact app stable until the Svelte version proves the same optimizer behavior.
2. Continue extracting framework-neutral TypeScript helpers from Preact components.
3. Keep bulk session, settings merge, export naming, MIME sniffing, saved settings, and processing orchestration independent of any UI framework.
4. Build a small SvelteKit prototype around imported pure modules before replacing production UI.
5. Port one vertical slice at a time: import, selected image state, options, encode result, export.
6. Run browser smoke tests before switching production routing or service-worker behavior.

Avoid a direct component-by-component translation if it carries old assumptions forward. Use the migration as a chance to simplify state and ownership.

## Svelte 5 rules to follow

Use the Svelte 5 runes model for new Svelte code:

- `$state` for local reactive state.
- `$derived` for computed values such as effective settings, selected job, output summaries, override badges, and export readiness.
- `$effect` only for side effects such as workers, object URLs, canvas, browser storage, timers, or third-party APIs.
- `$props` instead of `export let`.
- callback props and normal event attributes like `onclick` instead of `createEventDispatcher` and `on:click`.
- snippets and `{@render ...}` instead of legacy slots for reusable UI regions.
- keyed `{#each ...}` blocks for image jobs and thumbnails so job identity stays stable.
- `createContext` for typed editor or bulk-session context when prop drilling becomes awkward.

Do not use `$effect` to synchronize state that can be represented as `$derived`. This matters for bulk settings because global settings, per-image overrides, and effective settings are pure relationships.

## Large data and performance

Bulk image work involves large objects: `File`, `Blob`, `ImageData`, object URLs, encoded buffers, thumbnails, workers, and WASM module outputs. Do not put all of that into deeply reactive state by default.

Recommended pattern:

- keep reactive state focused on IDs, status, settings, sizes, errors, and selected job;
- keep binary data and long-lived browser objects outside deep proxies where possible;
- use `$state.raw` or normal module-local data for large immutable arrays or objects;
- use stable job IDs and keyed lists;
- revoke object URLs when jobs or previews are removed;
- keep concurrency limits in framework-neutral code.

Svelte's deep state proxies are useful for normal UI state, but large image payloads should be handled deliberately.

## SvelteKit cautions

If SvelteKit is used:

- prefer `adapter-static` and prerendered/static output unless a concrete server need appears;
- keep browser-only APIs behind browser-only execution paths;
- use `$app/environment` for `browser`, `dev`, and build-time checks when needed;
- remember that `$effect` only runs in the browser, not during server rendering;
- do not touch `window`, `document`, `localStorage`, `ImageData`, workers, or canvas during server execution;
- preserve service-worker and offline behavior before removing the current custom build path;
- avoid SPA-only output unless routing needs it, because SvelteKit warns that SPA mode can hurt startup, SEO, and no-JavaScript behavior.

The app can still be a static/offline tool. SvelteKit does not require server-side image processing.

## What this migration can remove later

Only remove these after equivalent behavior is verified:

- Preact component state and `setState` patterns.
- Preact-specific option rendering.
- Custom CSS-module type generation if Svelte scoped styles replace it.
- Some custom Rollup plugins if Vite/SvelteKit handles workers, WASM, assets, prerendering, and service-worker output safely.
- Local event-dispatch patterns where callback props or typed context are simpler.

Do not remove these early:

- current WASM codecs and workers;
- service-worker/offline support;
- single-image editor behavior;
- existing smoke tests;
- codec files that are still referenced by generated metadata or cache lists.

The detailed extraction inventory is intentionally not repeated here anymore.
Use [Maintenance status](maintenance-status.md) and the commit history when you
need the full record of Phase 1 helper extraction. For migration work, preserve
the pure boundaries around import, decode, preprocess, process, encode,
scheduling, saved settings, export naming, object URL cleanup, and bulk session
logic so the current optimizer remains testable before any production rewrite.

## Bulk feature alignment

The bulk backend helpers should stay easy for SvelteKit to consume later:

- prefer the helper barrel at `src/client/lazy-app/bulk/index.ts` when a SvelteKit prototype needs bulk session, queue, export, snapshot, settings, selected-detail, strip, and summary helpers together;
- sessions should be plain data;
- selectors should be pure functions;
- reducers/actions should not import Preact;
- job lists should expose stable IDs;
- per-image override detection should be derived, not effect-driven;
- export/session summaries should be pure and testable;
- browser resource cleanup should be explicit.

This lets a future Svelte UI show a strip of images, global settings, per-image overrides, and export readiness without duplicating business logic.

## Testing gates

Before production migration:

1. Current Preact app passes `npm run check`.
2. Browser smoke covers real import, WebP output, export link creation, and saved settings.
3. Pure helper tests cover bulk session transitions and export calculations.
4. A SvelteKit prototype proves the same helper modules work without Preact.
5. Service-worker/offline behavior is verified in the new build.
6. A real image can be imported, optimized, previewed, and exported in the Svelte build.

When Svelte components are added, use Svelte's recommended testing path: Vitest for extracted logic and component tests, Playwright for full user flows.

## Historical decision log

This section records the migration evidence that led to the root SvelteKit app.
It is not the live task list. The live task list is in
[the project brief](../project/brief.md), [MIGRATION-PLAN.md](MIGRATION-PLAN.md), and
[road-map.md](../project/roadmap.md).

- SvelteKit static output remains the migration target. The prototype has been
  promoted to the repo root on the `svelte` branch.
- WebP 2 stays included as experimental parity until direct maintainer testing
  proves it should be hidden or removed. Do not promote it as a primary product
  codec or spend threaded-runtime/product-positioning effort on it without a
  fresh decision.
- Migration seam work has been folded into the root app. The first seam was a
  generated `client/lazy-app/feature-meta/shared` module that kept
  framework-neutral codec/processor/preprocessor metadata separate from the
  Preact encoder client entries exposed by the inherited `feature-meta` index.
- The first production `url:` replacement shape is now proven for the rotate
  preprocessor: keep the current Rollup adapter in production, split reusable
  worker logic into a runtime that accepts a WASM URL, and let the SvelteKit
  prototype generator provide that URL from a Vite `?url` manifest.
- The first production `entry-data:` replacement shape is now proven for
  service-worker cache planning: keep Rollup virtual imports at the production
  boundary, move cache selection into a helper that accepts plain
  `{ main, deps }` records, and let the SvelteKit prototype generator provide
  those records from Vite worker and asset URL imports. The shared cache planner
  also has active codec-cache helpers and an `active-to-cache.ts` boundary for
  migration work while the current production cache path remains full.
  `processor-support.ts` keeps thread, SIMD, WebP, and AVIF support
  detection shared between the full and active cache boundaries.
- The first production `service-worker:` replacement shape is now proven for
  registration: keep the Rollup URL adapter at the production boundary, move
  registration/update/share-target behavior into a helper that accepts an
  explicit service-worker URL, and let the SvelteKit prototype pass its emitted
  `/service-worker.js` URL.
- The first SvelteKit worker-surface admission shape is now generated: the
  prototype emits a ready method-name list for the shared worker bridge and a
  blocked-method inventory for codecs or worker methods that still need asset
  URL, thread-support alias, or type work before joining the Vite worker entry.
- Production generation now mirrors the same decision boundary at the source
  level with `src/client/lazy-app/worker-bridge/surface.ts`: active worker
  methods are listed separately from methods that still need asset, thread, or
  type proof. It also emits ignored `src/features-worker/active.ts` as a
  Comlink entry for the active method set and
  `src/client/lazy-app/worker-bridge/active-meta.ts` for the matching active
  bridge method names/types. `worker-bridge/active-bridge.ts` can construct a
  bridge over that active list, and `worker-bridge/active-index.ts` proves the
  matching Rollup adapter shape, while the current Preact/Rollup
  `features-worker/index.ts` remains unchanged for existing app behavior.
- AVIF decode is promoted through that admission list. It uses a generated AVIF
  decoder WASM asset manifest and local fixture decode proof, while the broader
  production worker surface remains filtered.
- AVIF encode is promoted through that admission list for a forced
  single-thread runtime path. The production AVIF worker accepts an injectable
  thread-support probe, the prototype uses generated AVIF encoder WASM URLs,
  and runtime proof produces AVIF `ftyp` output that decodes back through
  `avifDecode`. This does not prove AVIF threaded runtime parity; Vite still
  emits the threaded helper and MT WASM assets from the dynamic import graph.
- WebP decode is promoted through that admission list. It uses the generated
  WebP codec asset manifest plus decoder WASM URL injection, while the broader
  production worker surface remains filtered.
- QOI encode/decode are the first non-WebP codec methods promoted through that
  admission list. They use a generated QOI WASM asset manifest plus a type-only
  shared metadata export, while the full production worker surface remains
  filtered.
- JPEG XL encode/decode are promoted through that admission list for a forced
  single-thread runtime path. The production JPEG XL worker accepts an
  injectable thread-support probe, the prototype uses generated JPEG XL encoder
  and decoder WASM URLs, and runtime proof produces JPEG XL `ff 0a` output that
  decodes back through `jxlDecode`. This does not prove JPEG XL threaded runtime
  parity; Vite still emits the threaded helpers and MT/SIMD WASM assets from
  the dynamic import graph.
- MozJPEG encode is now promoted through the same admission list. It uses a
  generated MozJPEG WASM asset manifest plus local shared metadata constants
  instead of a runtime import from declaration-only codec types.
- Quantize is now promoted through the same admission list. It uses a generated
  ImageQuant WASM asset manifest and a narrow ImageData-compatible worker return
  fix, while the full production worker surface remains filtered.
- Worker resize is now promoted through the same admission list. It uses a
  generated resize/HQX WASM asset manifest and optional injected wasm-bindgen
  URLs, while the default production initialization path remains intact.
- Single-thread OxiPNG encode is now promoted through the same admission list.
  It uses a SvelteKit `worker-shared` alias, a generated OxiPNG WASM asset
  manifest, and optional injected wasm-bindgen URLs. The parallel OxiPNG helper
  and WASM assets still need a separate threaded-runtime proof before production
  migration.
- The first generated encoder metadata split is now proven. Production
  `feature-meta/encoders` imports runtime-only encoder modules and shared
  metadata without Preact option components, while the existing
  `feature-meta/index` remains the Preact option-entry surface. The SvelteKit
  prototype imports production `decodeSourceImage`, `preprocessImage`,
  `processImage`, and `compressImage` for its WebP path through this encode-only
  map and a generated SvelteKit worker bridge.
- Generated `feature-meta/processors` and `feature-meta/preprocessors` now expose
  framework-neutral processor/preprocessor metadata maps and defaults without
  Preact option components. Generated UI option entries remain a later concern.
- Production `image-pipeline.ts` now delegates decode, preprocess, process, SVG
  handling, and generic encoder wrapping to `image-pipeline-shared.ts`, then
  keeps only the production encoder-map dispatch. This reduces drift between the
  current Preact app path and the SvelteKit-importable helper path.
- The production bulk processor now accepts the same structural
  `ImagePipelineWorkerBridge` type, so the SvelteKit prototype can import and
  run `processBulkImageJob` for the WebP path without importing the production
  Rollup worker adapter.
- The production compression update workflow now has SvelteKit prototype
  evidence. `runCompressionUpdateWorkflow` can run the WebP side outside the
  Preact component shell when given injected state patching, cache, worker
  bridges, and the production `imagePipeline` helper bundle. This narrows the
  future single-image slice risk to UI/control integration, full codec/threaded
  runtime parity, and static asset/service-worker strategy rather than the core
  update orchestration itself.
- `code/sveltekit-migration-seams`, `code/sveltekit-codec-assets`, and the
  single-image slice are historical inputs to the current `svelte` branch. Do
  not restart work from those branch names unless investigating history.
- The single-image slice target has been absorbed by the root app: import,
  decode, process, encode, preview, export, and offline behavior are the
  migration parity baseline.
- Decide final codec surface before deleting codec code.
- Use [Phase 1 readiness audit](phase-1-readiness-audit.md) only as historical
  rationale for why the SvelteKit spike started instead of continuing tiny
  Preact cleanup.
- Current browser support targets were reviewed on 2026-05-24. Re-check before production migration, but do not lower the modern evergreen baseline or remove WebAssembly, worker, service-worker, Canvas/ImageData, File/Blob, object URL, or dynamic import assumptions without measured evidence.
