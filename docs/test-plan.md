# Test strategy & plan

**Status: in progress. Last updated: 2026-08-11.**

Frisp's test strategy protects the browser-local image pipeline: import, decode,
process, encode, preview, export, and offline reload. The current suite has three
layers: static gates, pure unit tests, and full browser e2e.

---

## 1. Current model

| Layer | Command | What it checks | Cadence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Static gate | `npm run check` | wrapper patch sync + SvelteKit sync/typecheck, production build, static-output audit | every push/PR |
| Unit tests | `npm run test:unit` | pure helpers and bulk-engine reducers in Vitest | every push/PR |
| Browser e2e | `npm run test:e2e` | real production preview in Chromium + WebKit, codec bytes, threading, offline reload, bulk flows | every push/PR |

`npm test` runs `check`, `test:unit`, then Playwright with
`PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BUILD=1` so the e2e web server reuses the just-built output.
Formatting is separate (`npm run format:check` in CI) and Markdown is formatted
by hand.

---

## 2. What already exists

- Playwright e2e specs in `tests/e2e/`, run against the production static build
  on Chromium and WebKit. Coverage includes app shell isolation, codec encode
  magic bytes, alpha, quantize, resize, large images, threading, offline reload,
  editor interactions, the JPEG-to-JXL transcode, and bulk import/export flows.
  `jxl-transcode.spec.ts` is the guard for the one encode path that bypasses the
  pixel pipeline: the codec-encode suite would stay green with the whole branch
  broken, because it only ever exercises the pixel encoder.
- Vitest unit tests in `tests/unit/`, focused on pure bulk-engine/helper logic
  plus shared utility contracts.
- A benchmark harness (`benchmarks/`) with a fixture corpus and before/after
  comparison for codec changes.
- `npm run audit:static-output`, which checks emitted codec assets,
  service-worker asset selection, and duplicate-output hazards.

## 3. Remaining gaps, ranked

1. **Decoder-input matrix.** E2E mostly starts from browser-native JPEG/PNG;
   add AVIF/WebP/JXL/QOI input fixtures where WASM decode paths matter.
2. **SVG/vector path.** SVG import and future vector optimization need a stable
   browser smoke.
3. **Error paths.** Corrupt/unsupported imports, encoder throws, and bulk
   partial-failure/retry flows need automated coverage.
4. **Single-image helper extraction.** Some editor-session parsing, snapshot,
   and object-URL lifecycle logic still lives behind Svelte state and should be
   extracted before broad unit testing.
5. **Result cache/history units.** `ResultCache` and `EditorHistory` are high ROI
   for unit coverage because they protect undo, redo, pinning, and URL cleanup.

---

## 4. Unit-test plan (Layer 1 — the new work)

**Tooling:** **Vitest landed 2026-07-02** for the pure unit layer, with
`npm run test:unit` (`vitest run`), a minimal `vitest.config.ts` scoped to
`tests/unit/**/*.test.ts`, and shared `fixtures.ts` fake-`File` / job / session
builders. jsdom is not used; the current bulk-engine tests run in the default
Node environment with lightweight `File` fixtures. Unit tests are in CI and `npm test`; `npm run check` remains the static gate.

**Phase 2 landed 2026-07-03:** the engine unit layer added 13 cases for
`restoreJob`, the keep-original-when-larger export option, and `relativePath`
import/export naming, bringing bulk/helper coverage from 63 to 76+ cases. The
new bulk e2e smoke (`tests/e2e/bulk.spec.ts`) covers multi-entry bulk routing,
single-image editor regression, override dot signaling, real ZIP bytes, the
keep-original toggle, and remove+Undo.

The bulk engine is **clean to test**: every function is a pure reducer
(`(session, …) => newSession`), there is **no hidden `Date.now`/`Math.random`/
`crypto`**, and the few impure leaves already inject their dependencies
(`processor.ts` injects the pipeline + `createDownloadUrl`; `urls.ts` injects
`revokeObjectURL`; import injects the MIME sniffer). So tests need almost no
mocking.

### Proposed test files (~73 cases total)

| File | ~Cases | Status | Covers (highest-value contracts) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `queue.test.ts` | ~16 | **Implemented: 10 cases** | Scheduler gate (`getRunnableJobs`) + **counter integrity** across `startJob`/`completeJob`/`failJob`/`requeue*`. Includes stale stored-counter normalization, source-dimension-aware no-op resize staleness, mixed-size 50% resize requeue, stale requeue, incomplete requeue, exported-job requeue, and queue-state math. `cancelActiveJobs` remains planned. |
| `export.test.ts` | ~14 | **Implemented: 6 cases** | `getBulkExportEntries` **duplicate-name dedup** (case-insensitive, extension-preserving), size/export/output summaries, stale-output export gate, archive/output filename derivation, and marking export-plan entries exported. |
| `snapshot.test.ts` | ~10 | **Implemented: 5 cases** | `parseBulkSessionSnapshot` rejection matrix (malformed JSON, wrong version, missing settings, bad job/status/file/output) + restore **status demotion** (active/encoded/exported → queued, counters zeroed, selection fallback). |
| `import.test.ts` | ~9 | **Implemented: 5 cases** | `isSupportedBulkImage`, sync vs MIME-sniffed partition (sniffer throws → `unreadable`; non-image → `unsupported-type`), import summary, session creation, and append-to-session. |
| `settings.test.ts` | ~8 | **Implemented: 8 cases** | Deep override merging, encoder override replacement, `settingsHash` stability, disabled processor normalization, identity-resize collapse, per-job percentage-resize resolution, override detection, and override-path reporting. |
| `session.test.ts` | ~12 | **Implemented: 9 cases** | Counter normalization, unique job-ID dedup, remove/selection fallback, select-next/prev edges, global settings + overrides, `markJobsExported`, selected context, progress, and action-state selectors. |
| `output-filename.test.ts` | ~9 | **Implemented: 5 cases** | **Reserved Windows names** (`con`, `nul`, `com1`, `lpt9` → `-file`), illegal/control chars, path stripping, dotfiles, fallback names, and extension normalization. |
| `urls.test.ts` | ~5 | **Implemented: 3 cases** | Dedup collect + per-job/session revoke spy counts (leak prevention). |
| `size.test.ts` | ~4 | **Implemented: 2 cases** | `getPercentChange` shrink/growth and divide-by-zero (orig 0 → 0, not NaN). |
| `result-cache.test.ts` | ~8 | Planned | `ResultCache` (`src/lib/result-cache.ts`, plain TS — no DOM, ideal unit target): LRU recency on `get`, byte-budget + entry-cap eviction, **pinned keys never evicted**, `clear()` revokes every URL (spy counts), no double-insert. |
| `editor-history.test.ts` | ~8 | Planned | `EditorHistory` (`editor-history.svelte.ts` — needs the Svelte test env for runes): commit/undo/redo pointer math, signature dedup (no-op commit), redo-tail truncation on a new commit, `#limit` front-trim, `reset`/`clear`. |
| `detail/strip/summary.test.ts` | ~6 | Planned | Light composition smoke only — these are mostly selectors; **don't over-test**. |
| `changes.test.ts` | (folded) | Planned | "change a global setting → only stale jobs requeue, overrides preserved" — the core bulk promise. Partially covered through `queue.test.ts` + `settings.test.ts`, but not yet as the dedicated change reducer. |

### Top 8 highest-value targets (do these first)

1. ✅ `completeJob`/`failJob`/`startJob` — transition counter integrity.
2. ✅ `requeueStaleJobs` — "settings changed → rebuild only what's stale."
3. ✅ `parseBulkSessionSnapshot` — the only untrusted-input boundary; must never throw.
4. ✅ Restore status demotion — reload behavior.
5. ✅ `getBulkExportEntries` duplicate-name dedup — silent file overwrite risk.
6. ✅ `getBulkJobSizeSummary` + `getBulkExportSummary` — feed the whole UI dashboard.
7. ✅ `getSafeFileNameBase` — reserved names + sanitization.
8. ✅ `getRunnableJobs` + `getPercentChange` — scheduler math + the everywhere-used percentage.

### Extraction-for-testability (small refactors that unlock unit tests)

Some pure logic is currently trapped inside `.svelte`/`.svelte.ts` files behind
reactive plumbing, so it can't be unit-tested without booting the whole editor.
Extract to plain modules first (improves the code *and* enables the test):

- **High:** `editor-session.svelte.ts` helpers — `parseSavedSide`,
  `isValidProcessorState`, `snapshotProcessorStateForEncode`, `buildSide`,
  download-name logic → `editor-session-helpers.ts`. Unlocks table-testing
  malformed-localStorage and encode-snapshot logic.
- **Medium:** the WebP lossless-preset table +
  `determineLosslessQuality`/`setLosslessPreset` (`WebpOptions.svelte`) →
  `webp-lossless.ts`.
- **Medium:** `ResizeOptions` aspect-lock arithmetic →
  `computeLockedDimensions(w|h, aspect)` (a known bug class; also the template
  for crop's rect math).

---
## 5. E2E backlog

Add tests using the existing Playwright patterns:

- **Decoder-input matrix:** import `.jxl`, `.qoi`, `.avif`, and `.webp` fixtures
  as applicable, then assert dimensions and non-garbage output.
- **SVG import smoke:** import an SVG, rasterize, encode, and assert a valid
  output.
- **Unsupported/corrupt file:** assert a user-facing failure and no app crash.
- **Object-URL lifecycle:** assert eviction/clear paths revoke URLs and pinned
  displayed results survive while visible.
- **Future feature rule:** crop, Multi-Format Compare, and bulk Phase 3 should
  land with one e2e wiring smoke plus focused unit coverage under it.

---

## 6. CI state

CI now runs `check`, unit tests, format check, audit, and the full two-browser
e2e suite on every push/PR. Keep full e2e on every push unless runtime cost
becomes a real bottleneck; path-filtered e2e was considered earlier but is no
longer the current policy.

---

## 7. Cleanup notes

Keep framework-neutral engine code neutral; it is what makes the unit layer cheap
and keeps single-image and bulk behavior aligned. Optional future cleanup:
revisit stored bulk counters, extract remaining editor helpers, and unit-test
cache/history contracts before large UI changes.
