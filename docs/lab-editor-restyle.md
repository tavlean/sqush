# Editor re-style lab — porcelain, darkroom & hybrid (2026-07-07)

> **2026-07-18 update:** lab navigation was restructured — `/lab` is now a
> two-door index (main ui / intro page) and a thin tab bar over every
> experiment flips skins/variants in place; skins auto-load a shared sample
> (or the last file dropped anywhere in the lab) instead of showing a drop
> screen. A design unification + shared Nucleo icon pass ran across all
> three skins the same day: see
> [specs/2026-07-18-lab-design-unification.md](project/specs/2026-07-18-lab-design-unification.md)
> for the audit verdicts and per-skin worklists. Details below that
> describe per-skin theme pills, the old card index, or hand-drawn icons
> predate that pass.

Three dev-only lab experiments exploring a full visual re-skin (and, in two
of them, a re-arrangement) of the single-image editor — the first two
translated from reference screenshots the maintainer supplied in chat, the
third a maintainer-requested fusion of them. Goal: decide by LOOKING — pick a
direction for the editor's next visual iteration, and harvest control/panel
patterns for upcoming features (bulk overrides UI, keyboard control,
theming). A card-gallery INDEX at `/lab` links all experiments.

Both experiments are REAL editors, not mockups: they instantiate the
production `EditorSession`, encode with the real pipeline, and show real
sizes/undo/redo. Only the chrome is new. Zero production files were changed —
everything lives under `src/routes/lab/<name>/` (dev-gated exactly like the
old bulk lab: `prerender=false`, `dev` guard) and `src/lib/lab/<name>/`.

## How to run

`npm run dev`, then open **`/lab`** (the card gallery) — or directly
`/lab/porcelain`, `/lab/darkroom`, `/lab/hybrid`. All follow the system
light/dark preference and have a manual override (porcelain: a
System|Light|Dark pill top-right; darkroom & hybrid: a sun/moon rail button
cycling System→Light→Dark).

## Theming mechanism (shared idea, new to this app)

The production editor is dark-only. Both labs carry a dual-mode token set:
`color-scheme: light dark` on the lab root + every token defined with
`light-dark(light, dark)`; forcing a mode = setting `color-scheme` via a
`.force-light`/`.force-dark` class. Each lab overrides the EXISTING
`.editor-root` token contract (`--surface`, `--border`, `--text-*`, …) under
its own root class, so every reused production component (Output, option
panels, Results) re-skins without edits. If a lab is promoted, this is the
blueprint for app-wide light-mode support.

## Experiment 1 — `porcelain` (light, airy, squircle)

Reference: a 3D-design AI app in light mode. White floating panels on warm
light gray, large superellipse corners, two-level depth (raised = white +
hairline border + soft diffuse shadow; inset = recessed warm-gray track),
inset segmented controls with a raised active pill, thin-stroke icons,
sentence-case labels, near-invisible borders, dark tooltip pills with kbd
hints.

Feature mapping (reference → Frisp):

| Reference element | Frisp feature it drives |
| --- | --- |
| Floating top toolbar | Back, Undo/Redo (real history; "Undo ⌘Z" tooltips), Export = right side's Save |
| Design/Animation tabs | Edit \| Compress segmented tabs in the right panel (the two real OptionsPanel sections) |
| "Lens" dropdown rows | Encoder format picker as a custom clean dropdown |
| "Variations" popover | "Compare as…" 2-col format-tile grid (sets the left side's encoder) |
| Left panel + scene list | Filename header + image-info rows as airy list rows |
| Bottom prompt bar zone | Output's zoom/rotate/view cluster, re-skinned |

Squircles are real where supported: `@supports (corner-shape: squircle)`
bumps radii and sets `corner-shape`; elsewhere plain large radii.

## Experiment 2 — `darkroom` (dense pro-tool, rail + inspector + filmstrip)

Reference: a pro image-effects tool, provided in BOTH modes (dark-first).
Near-black flat page, compact chips (8–12px radii), micro-uppercase labels,
label-left/control-right rows with numeric chips, collapsible inspector
sections with an EYE icon per section, chip dropdowns, a left icon rail whose
buttons open panels, and a bottom timeline strip.

Feature mapping (reference → Frisp):

| Reference element | Frisp feature it drives |
| --- | --- |
| Top nav bar | frisp mark + EDITOR/DIAGNOSTICS nav, Export chip, "+" add-images, undo/redo chips |
| Left icon rail | Back, info flyout, compare flyout, rotate, theme toggle |
| Rail-opened panels | Flyouts: image info rows; Compare-as grid → left-side options when comparing |
| Section eye icons | REAL enable state: eye on "Resize"/"Reduce palette" = `processorState.*.enabled` |
| Chip dropdowns | Format picker + (restyled) selects in option rows |
| "Add animation" bottom button | Results footer's Save as a full-width chip button |
| Bottom timeline | SESSION FILMSTRIP: real multi-image gallery (add/drop many, click to switch, remove) — a stepping stone toward the bulk-override UI |
| Canvas corner chips ("4:3", "HQ") | Output's zoom/reset/rotate/view cluster restyled as bottom-right canvas chips |

## Experiment 3 — `hybrid` (darkroom IA in porcelain skin) — RECOMMENDED

The round-2 fusion (maintainer asked for it as a third view after the
orchestrator recommended it): darkroom's architecture — top brand bar, icon
rail opening flyouts (Image info / Compare), right inspector, bottom session
filmstrip — wearing porcelain's warm `light-dark()` tokens, squircles and
raised/inset depth. Its own signatures beyond the parents:

- Inspector drops darkroom's Adjust/Compress tabs for STACKED collapsible
  sections: Resize + Reduce palette (eye = real enable), always-on Compress.
- ONE bottom bar: the canvas zoom cluster is CSS-docked into the filmstrip
  bar's right end (`right: 24px`, centred in the 64px bar, 290px reserved
  well) — no stray floating control panels anywhere.

## Round-2 refinements to the parents (same session)

- Porcelain: zoom cluster moved INTO the top toolbar (reference-1 faithful);
  view-options popover flips downward; theme pill top-right.
- Both parents: light-mode purity — two-up scrubber, snackbar and
  ProcessingBadge themed via `light-dark()` (previously hardcoded
  studio-dark); tooltips stay near-black by design. Darkroom's range track
  was invisible (invalid non-final background color layer) — fixed with a
  flat-gradient layer.
- Squircle convention (maintainer-confirmed): base `border-radius` for every
  engine + `@supports (corner-shape: squircle)` switching on `corner-shape`
  with a RE-TUNED (larger) radius — superellipse corners read tighter at the
  same value. Porcelain + hybrid + the /lab index cards use it; darkroom
  intentionally keeps standard tight corners (its reference does).

## Status

- 2026-07-07: both experiments speced by the top-tier session, built by Opus
  subagents in parallel worktrees, merged, and verified in the dev preview at
  1440×900 in BOTH modes (real encodes, compare flow, dropdowns, filmstrip
  switching, eye-enable, flyouts). Commits: doc `791104cd`, porcelain
  `4e0cff81`, darkroom `7827b86f`. `npm run check` clean after each merge
  (porcelain adds 14 benign `corner-shape` CSS-lint warnings, gated behind
  `@supports`). One live fix during verification: porcelain's theme pill
  moved bottom-left → top-right (it collided with the left panel's results
  footer).

- 2026-07-07 round 2 (maintainer follow-up): hybrid built (`fe578225`),
  `/lab` index gallery (`f1c44129`, squircle cards `544726d7`), porcelain
  toolbar-dock + both-lab light purity (`ac2d992a`). All verified in dev at
  1440×900, both modes, real encode flows. `npm run check` clean throughout
  (corner-shape lint warnings only, `@supports`-gated).

- 2026-07-07 round 3 (maintainer request): PORCELAIN gained a full
  Pixelmator-style **crop tool** (`46cc7e27` + `3c7c97b9`; spec + model:
  [specs/2026-07-07-porcelain-crop-tool.md](project/specs/2026-07-07-porcelain-crop-tool.md)).
  It lives in `src/lib/lab/crop/` and is deliberately CHROME-AGNOSTIC (a
  CropTool state class + stage + panel over the `--pc-*` tokens) — if the
  decision below lands on hybrid, the crop tool ports with a restyle of
  CropPanel only; the geometry/stage/tool layers carry over unchanged.

## Decision

PENDING — maintainer to compare `/lab/porcelain`, `/lab/darkroom` and
`/lab/hybrid` (both modes each; start at `/lab`) and pick a direction or a
mix. The orchestrator's recommendation is **hybrid**. Record the outcome
here + in the registry row; delete losing lab code (git history keeps it).

## Ideas harvested while translating (candidates, NOT commitments)

1. **Eye-as-enable on section headers** (darkroom) — quieter than toggle rows
   for Resize/Reduce palette; frees the row for a collapse chevron.
2. **Manual theme toggle + light mode app-wide** — the labs prove the token
   mechanism; production could adopt `light-dark()` over the same contract.
3. **Encoder presets row** (from the reference's duotone presets grid) — e.g.
   "Web / Crisp / Max squeeze" chips above the quality slider; pairs with the
   parked fit-under-target ideas.
4. **Per-section "Reset to defaults"** (from "Randomize/Reset") — small,
   real gap; undo exists but a one-tap section reset doesn't.
5. **Numeric value chips beside sliders** (darkroom rows) — clearer than the
   current inline text fields at small sizes.
6. **Canvas status chips** (aspect ratio, smoothing state) — surfacing state
   the app already computes (`aspect.ts`, view options) as glanceable chips.
7. **Session filmstrip → bulk** — the darkroom strip is a live prototype of
   "batch as a strip under the canvas"; informs the Phase-3 override UI and
   the strip/stack direction in `bulk-ui-design-options.md`.
8. **Tooltip language with kbd hints** — both references use dark pills with
   right-aligned shortcuts; pairs with `docs/keyboard-control.md`.
