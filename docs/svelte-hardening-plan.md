# Frisp Post-Migration Cleanup & Svelte Hardening Plan

Last updated: 2026-07-07.

Read [the project brief](project/brief.md) first for live state. The SvelteKit 2 / Svelte 5
migration is **concluded** — `main` is the production app and the retired
Preact/Rollup app lives on the `preact` branch (tag `preact-final`). This
document is the next track: **clean up, simplify, and make the codebase fully
idiomatic Svelte 5** without changing user-facing behavior.

The components are line-by-line ports of the original Squoosh Preact `.tsx`
files, so the residue is concentrated at component _boundaries_ (raw-event
props, mirrored form state) and in the _reactivity mindset_ (effect-set-state,
mutable "previous value" guards) — not in Svelte-4 syntax. There is **no**
`createEventDispatcher`, no `on:` directives, no `export let`, no `$:`, and no
`writable()` stores anywhere. This is hardening, not rescue.

Findings below were produced by two independent automated review passes and cross-checked. Each item notes whether it was verified against the code.

> **Port-faithfulness re-audit (2026-06-28).** A user-reported resize/compare
> regression (the two-up split stopped aligning on a resized-down output) was
> traced to an over-narrowed conditional from the port and fixed; a 3-agent re-audit
> of the display / options / session layers found no other major regression. The
> full record — the fix, the audit, the new "in-place replace" reset-policy
> deviation, and the cosmetic preset-label fix — lives in
> [parity-audit.md](parity-audit.md) (the 2026-06-28 re-run + §A.9), not duplicated
> here. The Wave-0 two-up divider "2"-key fix below was re-confirmed still correct.

## Working rules for this phase

- Behavior-preserving only. Protect import → decode → process → encode →
  preview → export → service-worker/offline. Regressions there are blockers.
- Use the Svelte MCP docs and run the Svelte autofixer after meaningful Svelte
  edits. Keep `npm run check` green and browser-verify UI changes.
- Land in small, reviewable tranches (one wave or a few related items per
  commit). Re-run the parity expectations from
  [parity-audit.md](parity-audit.md) after editor changes.
- Keep `File`, `Blob`, `ImageData`, workers, WASM, and object URLs out of broad
  reactive state (existing rule — Wave 0 enforces it).

---

## Wave 0 — Confirmed defects & rule violations (do first; small, high value)

> **Done 2026-06-01** (commit `c11544dc`). Gate green, autofixer clean,
> browser-verified (encode + re-encode render, divider centers at 0.5, settings
> persist, no console errors).

- [x] **Fix the two-up divider "2" key bug.** `_relativePosition` is set to
      `0.25` instead of `0.5` because of a stray `/ 2`
      ([two-up.ts:105](../src/lib/editor/output/two-up.ts:105)). `_setPosition()`
      paints 50% immediately, but `_resetPosition()` (on orientation change /
      resize, [two-up.ts:125](../src/lib/editor/output/two-up.ts:125)) recomputes
      from the stored `0.25`, so the divider jumps to 25%. Fix: drop the trailing
      `/ 2` so it matches the `Digit3` branch shape
      ([two-up.ts:113](../src/lib/editor/output/two-up.ts:113)). _
      verified. Effort: trivial._
- [x] **Get browser host objects out of deep `$state`.**
      `results = $state<[CompressOutcome | null, …]>`
      ([editor-session.svelte.ts:181](../src/lib/editor/editor-session.svelte.ts:181))
      deep-proxies objects that hold `File`, `ImageData`, and a Blob-URL string
      ([compress.ts:152](../src/lib/compress.ts:152)). This violates the project's
      own "no heavy browser objects in reactive state" rule. The reactive UI only
      needs sizes, percent, dimensions, the URL string, and `isOriginal`; the
      `ImageData`/`File` are consumed imperatively by the canvas in `Output`. Fix:
      use `$state.raw` on `results` (reassign on update), or split a plain-data
      result DTO from a non-reactive store of the host-object refs. _
      verified. Effort: medium._
- [x] **Debounce `persistSettings()`.** It runs from a bare `$effect` with no
      throttle ([editor-session.svelte.ts:321](../src/lib/editor/editor-session.svelte.ts:321),
      [+page.svelte:37](../src/routes/+page.svelte:37)), serializing and writing
      JSON to `localStorage` on every reactive tick — ~60×/sec while dragging a
      quality slider. Fixed: payload is serialised synchronously (so the `$effect`
      still tracks its deps) but the `localStorage` write is deferred 200 ms;
      `dispose()` flushes any pending write so the last edit is never dropped.
      _

## Wave 1 — Dead-code purge (pure subtraction; verify with `npm run check`)

> **Done 2026-06-01** (commit `25fe0669`). 187 lines removed; gate green;
> browser-verified (clean reload boots + encodes + settings persist).

All low-risk deletions. The `src/client/lazy-app/*.ts` logic tree is **live** —
only the items below are dead.

- [x] Delete `src/shared/missing-preact-types.d.ts` — dead `preact` module shim;
      nothing imports `preact`. It also actively suppresses the type error that
      would catch a stray `import … from 'preact'`. _
- [x] Delete `src/client/lazy-app/util/clean-modify.ts` — `cleanMerge`/`cleanSet`
      are Preact's immutable copy-on-write helpers; **zero callers** repo-wide and
      conceptually obsolete under `$state` in-place mutation. _
      verified zero callers._
- [x] Remove dead React-onChange helpers from `src/client/lazy-app/util/index.ts`:
      `inputFieldValueAsNumber`, `inputFieldChecked`, `inputFieldCheckedAsNumber`,
      `inputFieldValue` (plus unused `shallowEqual`, `transitionHeight`). Kept
      `isSafari` (live). Also-dead but kept (out of scope): `konami` (the
      deliberate ZX easter-egg) and the trivial `preventDefault`. _
      verified no callers._
- [x] Delete the stale CSS-module `*.css.d.ts` stubs and the dirs that hold only
      them (`src/client/lazy-app/Compress/**`, `src/shared/prerendered-app/**`,
      `src/shared/custom-els/**`, `src/client/initial-app/**`,
      `src/static-build/**`, plus `theme.css.d.ts`, `output/two-up.css.d.ts`,
      `output/pinch-zoom.css.d.ts`). **Note:** `*.css.d.ts` is gitignored, so
      these were never committed — removed from the working tree only; a fresh
      clone never had them. The side-effect `import './x.css'` resolves via
      `vite/client`'s ambient `*.css` declaration. _

## Wave 2 — The dominant Preact-ism: controlled-component event boundary

> **Done 2026-06-01** (commits `89e710a2` 2a Checkbox/Toggle, `216292e9` 2b
> Select, `f04e55e2` 2c Range/number inputs). Every `currentTarget as HTML…`
> cast helper is gone from the panels (verified zero). Gate green throughout;
> browser-verified WebP/AVIF lossless toggles, MozJPEG enum select, format
> switch, and resize aspect-ratio.

Highest leverage — one change at the primitives ripples through every panel.

- [x] **Narrow the form-primitive event contracts.** `Select`, `Checkbox`,
      `Toggle`, and `Range` currently expose `onchange?: (event: Event) => void`
      (raw DOM event up), forcing every caller to re-implement
      `Number((e.currentTarget as HTMLSelectElement).value)` /
      `(e.currentTarget as HTMLInputElement).checked`. Type callbacks as the _value_
      (`(value: string) => void`, `(checked: boolean) => void`) doing the one cast
      inside the primitive, or lean on the `$bindable()` already declared and let
      callers `bind:value` / `bind:checked` (`Wp2Options` already proves this with
      `bind:value={options.uv_mode}`). Deletes the `numValue` / `checked()` cast
      helpers from every panel. _
- [~] **Make `options` ownership explicit.** _Partially done:_ plain fields now
  flow through `bind:`/`$bindable`, making ownership explicit; the
  mirror-state panels (AVIF/JXL) still mutate via `apply()` and are addressed
  in Wave 3. Children currently mutate fields of a mutable proxy passed
  down one-way
  ([OptionsPanel.svelte:151](../src/lib/editor/OptionsPanel.svelte:151),
  [ResizeOptions.svelte:41](../src/lib/editor/options/ResizeOptions.svelte:41),
  [WebpOptions.svelte:47](../src/lib/editor/options/WebpOptions.svelte:47)). It
  works (mutating a passed `$state` proxy is reactive) but ownership is implicit;
  prefer `$bindable`/`bind:` or explicit setter methods. Pairs with the item
  above. _

## Wave 3 — Promoted to its own project

> **Out of cleanup scope.** The AVIF/JXL mirror-state + `apply()` is the most
> Preact-flavored code left, but it also encodes real UX (e.g. Lossless mode
> remembers your lossy quality, inter-field rules, inferred toggles), so it can't
> be flattened to plain `bind:` without regressions. Rather than a minimal
> collapse, this is being treated as a forward-looking investment: a shared
> **codec options model** that maps raw codec fields ↔ human controls in one
> place, makes panels thin and testable, and pre-pays presets / target-size /
> bulk per-image overrides. Design + plan: [codec-options-model.md](codec-options-model.md).
> To be started fresh after Waves 4–6. (This also absorbs the old "data-driven
> codec panels" deferred item.)

## Wave 4 — Reactivity-model cleanups (retire React-style guards)

> **Done 2026-06-01** (commit `d943b611`). Core/parity-sensitive — gate green
> and browser-verified end to end (immediate first encode, 100ms-debounced
> option change, format switch, resize-dims seed + re-seed on a new file,
> new-file reset + view re-fit, the 500ms spinner appearing mid-encode and
> clearing on done, clear→reopen) with no console errors. The
> [parity-audit.md](parity-audit.md) expectations hold.

- [x] Replace the `prevFiles` mutable "previous value" ref and the `dimsSeeded`
      one-shot boolean with `loadId`-scoped comparisons
      ([editor-session.svelte.ts](../src/lib/editor/editor-session.svelte.ts)).
      encodeSide compares the live `loadId` to a per-side `encodedLoadId` (new
      file → immediate encode, option tweaks → debounced); seedResizeDimensions
      compares `seededLoadId`. Both auto-reset on the next file, so
      `pickFiles`/`clearFile` no longer hand-reset them. _
- [x] `showSpinner`: now a `$derived` AND-gate of (`status === 'working'`) and a
      new `spinnerDelayPassed` flag; `updateSpinner` keeps only the 500ms delayed
      flip. The gate guarantees the spinner can't show outside a working spell.
      _
- [x] Move the encode/spinner `$effect`s into `EditorSession` via an
      `$effect.root()` in the constructor (torn down in `dispose()`); `+page.svelte`
      keeps only the route-coupled `syncRouteState` effect. _
- [x] Diagnostics page: convert the `onMount` probes + manual `cancelled` guard
      to per-probe `$effect`s with cleanup
      ([diagnostics/+page.svelte](../src/routes/diagnostics/+page.svelte)).
      **Done** (`faa14e4d`): three independent `$effect`s, each with its own
      cancel guard (+ AbortController for the pipeline probe) and cleanup; the
      SW registration stays in a small `onMount`. Browser-verified all three
      probes resolve. _

## Wave 5 — Output attachments & small idiom wins

- [x] Convert the last `use:focusOnMount` action to `{@attach}` for consistency
      with `file-drop.ts` ([Output.svelte](../src/lib/editor/output/Output.svelte)).
      **Done** (`2660c1b9`).
- [x] Extract the imperative event-retargeting `$effect` into a parameterized
      `{@attach}` attachment. **Done** (`2660c1b9`): now `retargetViewEvents()`,
      an `Attachment<HTMLElement>` factory in
      [output/retarget-events.ts](../src/lib/editor/output/retarget-events.ts),
      applied as `{@attach retargetViewEvents(() => pinchLeft)}` on `<two-up>`
      (getter-parameterised so it re-runs once the left pinch-zoom is bound).
      Left the canvas-draw/fit `$effect`s as-is (they read several reactive
      props and read cleanly already). Browser-verified wheel-zoom retarget +
      focus-on-reveal. _
- [x] Replace the `downloadAttributes` `$derived`-object spread on `<a>` with
      conditional attributes (`href={disabled ? undefined : …}`)
      ([Results.svelte](../src/lib/editor/Results.svelte)). **Done** (`780ad8af`).
- [x] Wrap the inline `determineLosslessQuality(...)` template call in a
      `$derived` ([WebpOptions.svelte](../src/lib/editor/options/WebpOptions.svelte)).
      **Done** (`780ad8af`).
- [x] Drop the shallow `$derived` aliases over the non-reactive diagnostics model
      and the `onInput` wrapper. **Done** (`780ad8af`).
- [x] Guard `customElements.define` with `if (!customElements.get(name))`
      ([pinch-zoom.ts](../src/lib/editor/output/pinch-zoom.ts),
      [two-up.ts](../src/lib/editor/output/two-up.ts)) to avoid HMR / double-eval
      `NotSupportedError`. **Pulled forward and done 2026-06-01** (it was breaking
      dev HMR for these modules and would have dogged Waves 2–6). _
      AI; verified. Dev-only impact._

## Wave 6 — Structural simplification (readability ROI)

> **Done 2026-06-01** (commits `fc03306b` AdvancedSection, `a04ab2bc`
> OptionRow/ToggleRow, `50e7e7b3` root `+layout.svelte`). Gate green; browser-
> verified panel layout, format switch, branch swaps, slide reveals, and the
> body font/background on both routes.

- [x] Extract a shared "Advanced settings" component
      (`options/AdvancedSection.svelte`, owns `open`, renders a children snippet) —
      replaced the scaffold duplicated across AVIF/WebP/WP2/MozJPEG. **Done**
      (`fc03306b`); browser-verified in all four panels. _
- [x] Extract `OptionRow` / `ToggleRow` components to replace the repeated
      `<div class="option-one-cell">` / `<label class="option-toggle">` wrappers
      across the panels. **Done** (`a04ab2bc`). Two thin wrappers own the shared
      grid markup; `ToggleRow` takes the label as a prop + the control as
      children, both accept an optional `slide` for reveal rows, and `ToggleRow`
      takes an extra `class` for the gray `section-enabler` variant. Converted
      WebP/MozJPEG/Wp2/Resize/BrowserJPEG/OxiPNG/Quantize + OptionsPanel; AVIF/JXL
      left for the codec-options-model project; the format picker's
      `<section class="option-one-cell options-section">` stays raw. Browser-
      verified layout, format switch, Lossless branch swap, and the slide reveals.
      _
- [x] Add a root `src/routes/+layout.svelte` for the shared body font stack +
      reset (was duplicated in both route pages). **Done** (`50e7e7b3`). The
      layout owns `body { margin: 0; font-family: … }`; each page keeps its own
      background/color and the editor its full-height sizing. Browser-verified on
      both routes.

## Wave 7 — First-principles Svelte idiom polish

> **Done 2026-07-07** (WS-F in
> [specs/2026-07-07-first-principles-execution.md](project/specs/2026-07-07-first-principles-execution.md)).
> Gate green: `npm run check`, `npm run test:unit`, and full `npm run test:e2e`
> (61 passed / 1 known WebKit offline skip). Svelte MCP/autofixer was requested
> by the spec but no Svelte-specific MCP/autofixer tool was available in this
> session.

- [x] Replace local viewport `$state` plus `<svelte:window
      bind:innerWidth/bind:innerHeight>` with `svelte/reactivity/window` in
      `FocusView`, `StackStage`, and `Output`.
- [x] Replace the manual `matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)')`
      listener in `ProcessingBadge` with `new MediaQuery(...)`.
- [x] Extract one shared `lightDismiss` `{@attach}` factory for the three
      popovers in `ImageInfoPanel`, `Output`, and `FocusView`, preserving
      pointerdown capture dismissal and Escape focus return.
- [x] Evaluate the `StackStage` `{#key}` reset idea. Skipped by design: keying
      markup would not remove both script-level guards (`lastSignature`,
      `lastSplitTopId`) without extracting more component state.

## Deferred — bigger / design-dependent (do after the waves above)

- **Konami → "ZX" palette easter-egg (revisit together).** Upstream Squoosh hid a
  ZX-Spectrum-style palette behind the Konami code (↑↑↓↓←→←→BA). The **engine is
  still intact** — `quantize/worker/runtime.ts` honours `opts.zx` via
  `zx_quantize` — but the Svelte UI omitted the unlock trigger, so `konami()`
  (`client/lazy-app/util/index.ts`) currently has no caller. **Decision: keep it**
  (deliberately retained; see the code comment on `konami()`), and later put our
  own spin on it so it reads as "noticed and evolved," not untouched. Re-wiring
  would mean: on Konami in the Reduce-palette panel, reveal a control that sets
  `options.zx = 1`. To discuss before implementing.
- **Context API for `OptionsPanel`.** Pass `EditorSession` / per-side state via
  context to collapse the ~15-prop interface
  ([+page.svelte:119](../src/routes/+page.svelte:119)). Matter of taste given the
  singleton is already reactive; do it _after_ Wave 2 so the boundary is clean
  first. **Use `createContext`** (type-safe) rather than raw
  `setContext`/`getContext` — that's the current best-practice (confirmed via the
  Svelte MCP, 2026-06-02).
- **Data-driven codec panels.** Folded into the codec options model project —
  see [codec-options-model.md](codec-options-model.md).
- **Legacy service-worker / cache surfaces.** ✅ **Done 2026-06-10**, as part of
  the performance pass (which WAS the SW-focused pass with build + offline
  verification this item asked for). Both suspicions confirmed dead and
  deleted: `createServiceWorkerBridge` (`skip-waiting`/`share-ready`/
  `cache-all`) + `sw-bridge/support.ts` had zero callers and no SW message
  handlers (only `registerServiceWorkerUrl` survives), and the Squoosh
  entry-data modeling in `src/sw/cache-plan.ts` was replaced by the
  variant-aware precache selection. Verified by `npm run check` + the full
  Playwright e2e incl. offline reload. See [the project brief](project/brief.md) and
  [build-and-runtime.md](build-and-runtime.md).

## Explicitly not in scope

- Production bulk UI (roadmap; needs design — see [road-map.md](project/roadmap.md)).
- Codec pruning / visibility changes (separate engineering decision; follow
  [codec-provenance.md](codec-provenance.md)).
- Server-side processing or upload paths.
- `class:` → `class={…}` object-form conversion — low value here, but note the
  current Svelte 5 **best-practices doc does recommend** clsx-style array/object
  `class` over the `class:` directive (confirmed via the Svelte MCP, 2026-06-02).
  So it's a sanctioned cleanup if a component's `class:` usage gets unwieldy —
  just not worth a sweeping pass. Skip unless it improves a specific component.

## Dropped after verification

- "Unguarded `localStorage` reads in `hasSavedSide`/`importSide`" (second AI) —
  **refuted**: both early-return behind `canUseLocalStorage()`
  ([editor-session.svelte.ts:121](../src/lib/editor/editor-session.svelte.ts:121),
  [editor-session.svelte.ts:450](../src/lib/editor/editor-session.svelte.ts:450)).
  Only a marginal stylistic inconsistency remains (existence-check vs the write
  paths' `try/catch`); not worth a dedicated change.
