# Editor parity audit & deviation log

Last updated: 2026-07-12.

Goal: the Svelte editor must not **lose** any feature or gain any bug relative
to the original Preact Squoosh editor. This doc tracks (a) deliberate deviations
made during migration, (b) things that need the user's input/discussion before
acting, (c) the running gap list from the automated parity audit, and (d) items
deferred by explicit decision.

The audit is a multi-agent workflow (`editor-parity-audit`) that enumerates the
original editor's behaviors area-by-area, classifies each against the Svelte
source, then adversarially re-verifies every flagged gap to drop false
positives. Last run 2026-05-31: **107 behaviors audited, 41 confirmed gaps**
(9 major, 24 minor, 8 trivial). Re-run after significant editor changes.

**Re-run 2026-06-01** — regression-focused pass after the `EditorSession`
refactor (editor logic extracted from `+page.svelte`) and the repo "flip" to
root. Scoped to only the changed surfaces (4 finder agents + adversarial
verify; the byte-identical ~90% of the editor was skipped). **61 behaviors
verified, ZERO major regressions.** 8 minor/trivial gaps found and ALL FIXED
(commits "Fix editor-state parity regressions…" + "Restore Output touch/focus
workarounds…"); 1 dismissed:

- FIXED (minor): rotate 90/270 now swaps the Resize width/height (had left the
  fields + preset stale vs the rotated source); SVG sources default the resize
  method to "vector" again (had reverted to lanczos3); the encoder dropdown no
  longer momentarily lists unsupported browser encoders before `canvas.toBlob`
  detection; the Import button now validates the stored payload (was
  key-presence only); processor-state import validation rejects partial/null
  inner values, matching the original.
- FIXED (trivial): "settings saved" snackbar back to 1500ms; Android-Chrome
  `touchend` active-element blur restored; Firefox focus-reflow before the
  zoom-edit input restored.
- DISMISSED: the tab-title hourglass starts ~100ms earlier on option changes —
  cosmetic, sub-perceptible, clears correctly. Not a regression.

Rotate-swap and SVG-vector were browser-verified; the rest are code-level
parity restorations (svelte-check 0/0, build green).

**Follow-up 2026-06-01 (Svelte-hardening Wave 4, commit `d943b611`).** The
`EditorSession` reactivity was refactored (loadId-scoped guards replacing
prevFiles/dimsSeeded; `showSpinner` as a `$derived` AND-gate; encode/spinner
`$effect`s moved into the class via `$effect.root`). Behavior-preserving and
browser-verified that these four expectations still hold: immediate first
encode, 100ms-debounced option change, 500ms delayed spinner (seen appearing
mid-encode and clearing on done), and reset-view-on-a-new-file. No regressions.

**Re-run 2026-06-28 — targeted port-faithfulness re-audit + a found regression.**
A user report (resizing the output made the two-up "resize in place" so the split
stopped aligning) traced — via `git log -S` — to commit `6718bbc9` ("Align
contain-resized output…", §B): the port had **narrowed** the original's
_unconditional_ canvas-box pinning to fire only when the resize fitMethod is
`contain`, so the default `stretch` downscale rendered the output canvas at its
intrinsic (smaller) size and the two halves no longer shared a footprint.
**Fixed (commit `596661e2`):** restored the original `getOutputPreviewImageState`
invariant — both canvases' CSS box is pinned to the preprocessed source dims
unconditionally (shared `$derived` box dims + `style:` directives), with
`object-fit: contain` added per-side only on a contain-resized side; `fitTarget`
degated in lockstep. Guarded by a new e2e
(`tests/e2e/resize-twoup-footprint.spec.ts`).

Three agents then re-audited the **display layer**, the **options/processor
surface**, and the **session state machine** against pristine upstream Squoosh —
**no other major regression.** Recommend-leave leftovers: `leftDraw/rightDraw`
borrows the sibling side rather than `source.preprocessed` (a documented
deviation, §A.6); `onScaleInput`'s stricter parse (unreachable behind
`<input type=number>`); the flex-center → JS-fit redesign. The cosmetic
preset-label rounding was **fixed** (commit `3341bdb0`: the `0.3333` preset
showed `33.33%`, not `33%`) — but that preset has **since been removed** in the
resize-UX cleanup (§A.10), so the point is moot. The `two-up.ts` divider "2"-key
value is the already-done Wave-0 item, not a new gap.

---

## A. Deliberate deviations (done, no input needed)

Intentionally different from the original because Svelte offers a cleaner idiom;
behavior parity is preserved.

1. **Drag-to-replace = a Svelte attachment**, not the `file-drop-element`
   custom element. `lib/editor/file-drop.ts` `fileDrop(onFiles)` (`{@attach}`)
   on the app wrapper; reactive, auto-cleaned, no custom-element registration.
2. **Snackbar = a rune-backed store**, not the `<snack-bar>` custom element.
   `lib/editor/snackbar-store.svelte.ts` + `Snackbar.svelte`; `show()` returns a
   promise resolving with the chosen action (so Undo works exactly like Squoosh).
3. **Encoder panels re-sync via `{#key options}`** instead of Preact's
   `getDerivedStateFromProps`. Remounting on options-object identity change is
   the idiomatic Svelte way to re-seed a panel after copy/import.
4. **Post-rotation dims via a derived value** off a new `preprocessedWidth/Height`
   on `CompressOutcome`, instead of the original reading `source.preprocessed`
   live each render.
5. **Results-bubble metrics shrunk** slightly so the size + percent badge +
   download blob fit the 300px panel without overflowing the viewport.
6. **Preview in-progress UX — restored fallback + new per-side badge
   (2026-06-03).** Two parts:
   - _Parity restoration:_ the original Squoosh Output falls back to
     `source.preprocessed` so a side is never blank while it encodes
     (`rightDrawable() = rightCompressed || source.preprocessed`). The Svelte
     port had **lost** this — the right panel sat BLANK through the whole first
     encode (very visible on slow codecs). Restored: each side now borrows the
     other side's image (`leftDraw/rightDraw = own ?? other`) until it has its
     own result. `Output.svelte`.
   - _Deliberate enhancement (beyond parity):_ a per-side in-progress **badge**
     over the relevant half — **"Optimising…"** on the first encode,
     **"Re-optimising…"** once a result exists and a setting change re-runs the
     encoder (the prior result stays on screen, crisp, while the new one
     computes). The original showed no in-canvas indicator and swapped silently.
     Gated by the same 500ms `showSpinner` delay as the download spinner, so fast
     encodes never flash it. **Design decision:** the badge is the _single_
     consistent "this side is working" signal — an earlier draft also blurred the
     placeholder, but that was inconsistent (blur on first encode, none on
     re-encode) and read as a bug; a clear text label is more honest than a blur,
     and keeping the previous result crisp on a re-encode lets the user still see
     their current output. `Output.svelte`, `+page.svelte` (passes
     `leftWorking/rightWorking`). **Extended 2026-06-28 (§A.10):** the badge now
     also reads **"Resizing…"** for resize-driven passes, and a resize at 100% is
     a no-op (no pass, so no badge).
7. **WebP default options diverge from upstream (2026-06-03):** quality **80**
   (was 75) and method **6** — highest effort / best compression (was 4) — set as
   the project's preferred default, since WebP is the default right-side encoder
   and stays sub-second even at method 6.
   `src/features/encoders/webP/shared/meta.ts`. The persisted-settings key was
   bumped `presk:settings:v2 → v3` so pre-existing saved side-settings (which
   would otherwise mask the new default) are discarded and the fresh default
   (left = Original, right = WebP) loads.

8. **Full visual redesign — the "studio" theme (2026-06-11).** The editor no
   longer mimics Squoosh's pink/blue look. New design system in
   `lib/editor/theme.css`: floating glass option panels (inset, blurred,
   bordered) instead of edge-flush black cards; per-side accents are now
   **coral (left, the brand squeeze-orange) / azure (right)** instead of
   pink/blue; section headers are uppercase labels with an accent tick instead
   of full-width colored bars; the Results speech-bubble + download blob were
   replaced by a panel footer (filesize + a semantic green/red delta badge + a
   "Save" pill button); the back blob is a round glass "X"; the two-up divider
   is a hairline with a glass scrubber; the zoom/tool buttons are glass pills;
   typography moved to the self-hosted **Outfit Variable** font (root stays
   12px rem-based). The landing page gained a gradient headline, a coral
   browse disc, codec chips, and staggered entrance reveals. **Behavior parity
   is untouched** — every control, shortcut, state machine, and the
   `--main-theme-color`/`--hot-theme-color` per-side variable contract remain
   (only the resolved values changed). `npm run check` green; verified in the
   browser at desktop + mobile widths.
   **Landing superseded 2026-07-15.** The landing described here (gradient
   headline, coral browse disc, codec chips, staggered entrance reveals) was
   retired. The live landing is now the "frame" viewfinder design in
   `src/lib/editor/intro/Intro.svelte`, and the app was rebranded: a new
   currentColor logomark (`src/lib/brand/logomark.svg`), a wordmark, and a
   theme-aware SVG favicon. The studio editor theme itself (panels, per-side
   accents, typography) is unchanged.

9. **In-place file replace resets per-image state but keeps the encoder
   (2026-06-28).** Dropping a new image over the open editor (or opening a fresh
   one) keeps each side's `format` + `optionsByFormat` (quality/effort/…) but
   **resets rotation and the whole processorState** — resize _and_ palette
   reduction. Upstream Squoosh preserved rotation + palette across an in-place
   replace; resetting them is a deliberate product decision (user, 2026-06-28):
   palette reduction is per-image and often _increases_ size, so silently carrying
   it onto an unrelated image is a footgun, and deliberate cross-image palette work
   will live in bulk edit. The rationale is pinned in a `pickFiles` code comment
   (commit `984788b1`) so a future audit doesn't "restore" the upstream behavior.
   (Undo/redo now exists — see §A.14 — but it is deliberately **per-image**:
   loading or replacing the image resets the history, so an in-place replace is
   _not_ itself undoable. The per-image reset is the intended scope, not an
   oversight.)

10. **Resize UX cleanup — shrink-only presets, context-aware badge, 100% no-op
    (2026-06-28).** Three deliberate departures from upstream Squoosh's resize panel:
    - **Shrink-only presets.** The preset dropdown is now `0.25 / 0.5 / 1`
      (25 / 50 / 100%). Squoosh's `200 / 300 / 400%` enlarge presets and the awkward
      repeating-decimal `33.33%` were dropped — Frisp is an optimizer, not an
      upscaler (no super-resolution; enlarging only spreads existing pixels). An
      exact larger target, or pixel-art hqx magnification, is still reachable by
      typing Width/Height via Custom. `resize/client/preset-state.ts` (commits
      `6a50f8bb`, `3741fe2b`). Supersedes the `33.33%` preset-label fix noted at the
      top — that preset no longer exists.
    - **Context-aware in-progress badge** (extends §A.6). The pill reads
      **"Resizing…" → "Resized"** when a pass is driven by a real resize edit, vs
      "(Re-)optimizing" otherwise; the call diffs each side's _effective_ resize
      recipe against the previous pass. `ProcessingBadge.svelte`,
      `editor-session.svelte.ts` (commit `059251c5`).
    - **Resize at 100% is a true no-op.** Squoosh always ran the resampler when
      resize was enabled. Frisp skips it when the target equals the source size:
      `processImage` skips the identity resample, and `editor-session` skips the
      whole re-encode when the effective request is unchanged — so enabling Resize
      (or toggling Premultiply/Linear RGB, or switching method, Mitchell included)
      at 100% does nothing. `image-pipeline-shared.ts`, `editor-session.svelte.ts`
      (commit `4a2a4af6`). Browser-verified; `svelte-check` 0/0.

11. **Integer-only Quality + magnetic round-number snapping on wide sliders
    (2026-06-28).** Two deliberate departures from upstream Squoosh's sliders:
    - **Quality is whole numbers.** Squoosh ran the WebP, JXL, and generic
      fallback Quality sliders at `step=0.1`; Frisp drops them to `step=1` (AVIF
      and MozJPEG were already integer, so this also unifies the surface). The
      `0.1` granularity was false precision the encoders don't reward perceptibly.
      JXL's Quality max becomes **99** (was `99.9`, a hack to keep it distinct from
      `100` = lossless); the Lossless toggle remains the only path to 100. The
      generic fallback Quality is now integer too. Commit `391b45d5`.
    - **Magnetic snapping (beyond parity).** `Range.svelte` now takes over the
      pointer drag on wide sliders (`max − min ≥ 50`: Quality, filter strength,
      smoothing, …) and warps the raw value toward the nearest multiple of 5
      (subtle) / 10 (stronger) with a monotonic cubic magnet — round numbers
      occupy more travel, but every integer stays reachable and the number field
      is the exact escape hatch. Keyboard stepping + a11y stay on the native
      input; narrow knobs (effort, sharpness) keep the plain native drag;
      `snap={false}` forces it off. Commit `59781001`. Browser-verified
      (89.3→90, 84.7→85, 83.0→83); `svelte-check` 0/0.

12. **Consistent Quality → Effort → Advanced tiering across option panels
    (2026-06-28).** Squoosh shows every encoder knob at one flat level; Frisp now
    leads each panel with its headline controls and folds the expert surface under
    the shared `AdvancedSection`. Ported from the "Modern UI redesign 2" branch
    (`clever-swartz-2b34ed`) idea, but made internally consistent (the branch left
    AVIF out) and kept on integer Quality (the branch still had fractional steps):
    - **JXL** had _no_ Advanced fold — Alternative-lossy, Auto/Edge-preserving
      filter, decoding-speed, photon-noise, and Progressive were all inline. They
      now live under Advanced; only Lossless, Quality, Effort stay primary. Dead
      `showAdvanced` state removed.
    - **WebP** lossy now reads Quality → Effort (was Effort → Quality); "Preserve
      transparent data" moves from a loose bottom toggle into Advanced in lossy
      mode, and stays directly visible in lossless mode (which has no fold).
    - **AVIF** Effort moves above Advanced (it was stranded _below_ it — the lone
      panel that broke the pattern, in the redesign branch too).
    - **Resize** Method + Premultiply + Linear RGB fold into Advanced; Preset /
      Width / Height / aspect / fit stay primary (Lanczos3 is the right default).
    - **OxiPNG** Effort before Interlace.
      Quality stays integer-only (§A.11 preserved — no fractional `step` reintroduced
      from the source branch). Touches the five panel files (`WebpOptions`,
      `AvifOptions`, `JxlOptions`, `ResizeOptions`, `OxipngOptions`); commit
      `abebdfaf`. Browser-verified all panels (collapsed + expanded); `svelte-check`
      0/0.

13. **Resize Method dropdown trimmed to four scalers (2026-06-28).** Upstream
    Squoosh exposes nine resampling methods — five worker filters (Lanczos3,
    Mitchell, Catmull-Rom, Triangle, hqx) plus four browser-canvas scalers
    (pixelated + low/medium/high) — and Vector for SVG. Frisp deliberately cuts the
    menu to four distinct jobs: **Lanczos3** (photos), **Mitchell** (graphics /
    less ringing), **hqx** (pixel-art upscale), **Browser pixelated** (nearest
    neighbour), plus **Vector** (auto for SVG). Rationale: `browser-low/medium/high`
    are strictly lower quality than the worker filters and vary by browser/OS;
    Catmull-Rom and Triangle are redundant middle points that Lanczos3 + Mitchell
    already bracket.
    - `catrom`/`triangle` stay in the worker code path (catrom finishes an hqx
      pass) and in the type unions — just no longer user-selectable.
    - `browser-low/medium/high` were removed outright: the type unions, plus the
      canvas helper (`BuiltinResizeMethod` → `'pixelated'`, `builtinResize` no
      longer branches on `imageSmoothingQuality`). The `/diagnostics` probe's
      browser-canvas leg moved `browser-high` → `browser-pixelated` (worker leg
      unchanged).
      Commits `d07aed17` (UI) + `5404d783` (types/code); user-guide + reference
      reconciled. `svelte-check` 0/0; browser-verified — the dropdown shows exactly
      the four options, Premultiply/Linear RGB appear for Lanczos3 and hide for
      Browser pixelated, and a browser-pixelated resize re-encodes cleanly with no
      console errors.

14. **Undo/redo + a shared, instant result cache (2026-06-28).** Squoosh has
    neither; Frisp adds both, as one feature. The editable document
    (`{ sides, preprocessorState }`) is snapshotted into a signature-deduped
    history (`EditorHistory`, `$state.raw` entries + `$state` index) by a debounced
    `$effect` watcher in `EditorSession`; **Undo/Redo** restore a snapshot and let
    the encode effect re-run. A separate `ResultCache` (LRU, byte-budgeted, **shared
    across both sides** because a result is a pure function of its inputs) keys
    finished `CompressOutcome`s by their encode signature — so restoring, revisiting
    any prior recipe (e.g. toggling Lossless back off), or one side matching the
    other shows the image **instantly** instead of re-encoding. The old single-slot
    `encodedSig`/`lastUrls` are subsumed; the cache now owns object-URL lifecycle
    (revoke on eviction/clear, displayed results pinned).
    - **Scope decisions:** global (both-side) timeline; **per-image** history (reset
      on load — a replace is not undoable, see §A.9); slider drags coalesce into one
      step (350ms settle); keyboard **⌘/Ctrl+Z** + **⇧⌘Z / Ctrl+Y**, suppressed in
      typeable fields so native text-undo survives.
    - Built as a `.svelte.ts` history module + plain-TS cache; Svelte MCP docs were
      consulted and the autofixer is clean. `npm run check` 0/0; browser-verified
      (≈470ms encode vs ≈20ms cached return; undo/redo and a cross-side settings
      copy both instant; no console errors). User-guide + reference reconciled.

> NOTE (import gotcha): shared `.svelte.ts` stores must be imported by the SAME
> specifier everywhere (we use `$lib/editor/snackbar-store.svelte`). A mix of
> `$lib/…` and relative `./…` makes Vite instantiate the store twice, so writes
> from one component never reach the other. Cost us a debugging cycle.

15. **Preview smoothing + background grouped into a "View options" popover
    (2026-06-28).** Squoosh (and Frisp until now) put the two preview-only display
    toggles — smoothing (`image-rendering: pixelated`) and the alternate
    background — as two always-visible buttons on the output control bar. They now
    sit behind a single **View options** affordance (a tune/sliders pill next to
    Rotate) that opens a small popover above the bar.
    - **Why:** both are preview-only (they change what you see, not the saved
      file) and low-frequency — smoothing is even a no-op until you zoom past 1:1 —
      so they didn't earn permanent space beside the zoom/rotate actions. Grouping
      them also removes a cross-browser wart: the smoothing toggle is omitted on
      Safari (`image-rendering: pixelated` is a no-op in WebKit), which used to give
      the bar a different button count there; the popover absorbs it (on Safari it
      simply shows the single Background row).
    - **Behaviour kept:** the underlying `pixelated` / `altBackground` state and the
      canvas wiring are unchanged; each row is still a toggle that reflects state via
      `aria-pressed` and shows its current value (On/Pixelated, Dark/Light).
    - **Added:** a dirty dot on the trigger whenever either toggle is in its
      non-default state (so a change stays discoverable while the popover is shut);
      light-dismiss via outside-`pointerdown` + Escape (Escape restores focus to the
      trigger).
    - `Output.svelte` only; commit `cadfaa16`. `svelte-check` 0/0 via `npm run
check`; browser-verified desktop + mobile (toggles apply to both canvases,
      click-outside + Escape dismiss, no clipping at 375px, no console errors).
      User-guide + reference reconciled.

16. **Two-up divider keys are scoped to the viewer (2026-07-02).** Upstream
    Squoosh (and Frisp until now) wired the `1`/`2`/`3` divider shortcuts as a
    window-level keydown guarded only against `<input>` targets, so they fire
    globally — pressing "2" while a toolbar button, a `<select>`, or the zoom
    `<span role="button">` was focused silently recentred the split. The handler
    now acts only when the event is unhandled, carries no Ctrl/Meta/Alt modifier,
    and focus is either on `document.body` or inside the viewer itself — keeping
    the shortcut when nothing is focused or while interacting with the two-up, but
    no longer hijacking "2" from unrelated controls. The `_position` math is
    unchanged. `two-up.ts`; commit `fix(editor): stop two-up divider keys firing
from unrelated controls`. `npm run check` 0/0; `resize-twoup-footprint`
    e2e green.

17. **Production bulk mode is a deliberate Frisp addition (2026-07-03).**
    Original Squoosh is a single-image editor; Frisp now opens a batch editor
    when 2+ supported files are imported, with global WebP settings, per-image
    overrides, folder import, Save all as ZIP, and remove+Undo. This is not a
    parity gap. The single-image editor path is unchanged for one file. Within
    bulk, the two-up divider follows the image shape via `orientationOverride`
    (landscape/square stays left-right even on narrow screens; clearly portrait
    images flip top-bottom), while the single-image `Output.svelte` default
    remains byte-for-byte unchanged.

18. **Single-image left panel defaults to image info (2026-07-03).** Upstream
    Squoosh always shows two encoder option panels, with the left side set to
    Original by default. Frisp now uses the left column as contextual image info
    first: filename, original format, size, dimensions, and inferred aspect
    ratio. The old live second encoder panel is preserved, but it is opt-in via
    **Compare as…**; choosing **Original Image** or closing compare returns the
    info panel. This is intentional: quick inspection is the common path, while
    two-encoder A/B remains available when needed.

19. **First-class SVG optimization (2026-07-12).** Upstream Squoosh could
    import an SVG and rasterize it into a pixel format, but it could not emit an
    optimized SVG. Frisp adds an SVG-to-SVG vector lane powered by SVGO v4: an
    Auto search visually verifies candidates at several sizes/backgrounds,
    Manual exposes precision and opt-in structural clean-ups, raw and gzip
    sizes are reported separately, and both sides use vector-true previews.
    The older SVG-to-raster path remains available and unchanged.

## B. Resolved decisions + still-open items

Resolved 2026-05-31 (user: "restore them; for the rest, make the best call"):

- **DONE — Browser-native encoders (Browser JPEG / PNG / GIF) restored** with
  runtime feature-detection (`getSupportedFormatIds()`); Browser GIF self-hides
  where canvas can't encode it. Browser JPEG got a 0–1 quality panel.
  **Superseded 2026-06-27:** these were removed again — they only duplicated the
  WASM codecs for the same formats (MozJPEG for JPEG, OxiPNG for PNG) and made
  larger files, so they were never useful in a compression tool. The
  feature-detection (`getSupportedFormatIds`) went with them. See
  [codec-surface-cleanup.md](history/codec-surface-cleanup.md) §3.
- **DONE — `contain` resize fitMethod** letterboxes inside the original footprint
  (canvas `object-fit: contain`), aligned at the two-up split. **Correction
  (2026-06-28):** the commit that added this over-narrowed the box-pinning to the
  `contain` case only, regressing the default `stretch` downscale; the box is now
  pinned for _all_ resizes, with `object-fit: contain` layered on only for Contain
  (see the 2026-06-28 re-run at the top).
- **DONE — History → SvelteKit shallow routing** (`pushState`/`page.state` from
  `$app/navigation`), replacing the raw `history` API (no more router warning).

Deliberate deviations (my call — re-open if you disagree):

1. **Pinch-zoom re-fits on a dimension change (rotate/resize)** rather than
   preserving the user's zoom/pan with the original's pan-compensation math.
   Re-fit is simpler and arguably nicer (re-centres the new framing); the
   compensation is risky for marginal benefit.
2. **`wp2` (WebP v2, "unstable") was experimental parity — now RESOLVED by
   removal (2026-06-02).** It was restored in the SvelteKit surface for migration
   parity, but the maintainer testing that decision called for was done (see
   [the codec upgrade audit](project/reports/2026-06-02-codec-upgrade-audit.md) §3) and concluded WebP 2 is a
   permanently-experimental format no browser can decode, so it was removed
   entirely — see [codec-surface-cleanup.md](history/codec-surface-cleanup.md). This
   parity item is closed.

Deferred to the post-migration roadmap (infra/product work, not migration
feature/bug parity):

3. **Shared decode.** Dual-side runs the full `compressFile` (incl. decode) per
   side — redundant on large images when comparing two encoders. Treat this as
   post-launch performance work.
4. **Share-target (PWA).** Needs an installable PWA + `share_target` manifest +
   a SW POST handler. Defer until the roadmap PWA track.
5. **`$app/*` type shim — DONE 2026-06-01.** `src/sveltekit-app.d.ts` was
   deleted. Root cause: the root `tsconfig.json` overrode `include`, which
   dropped the generated `ambient.d.ts` (it carries
   `/// <reference types="@sveltejs/kit" />`, the source of the real `$app/*`
   types). Fix: curate `include` to add the generated `ambient.d.ts` /
   `non-ambient.d.ts` / `$types` (a full inherit isn't possible — it pulls in
   `vite.config.ts` and crashes `svelte-check` with `forEachResolvedModule is
not a function`). The real types also caught a latent bug: `resolve('/logo.webp')`
   on a static asset — fixed to `asset('/logo.webp')` (`resolve()` is for routes).

## C. Verified parity gaps from the audit (status)

### Fixed in this pass (commit "Close audit parity gaps (batch 1)")

Major: browser/in-app Back (history+popstate) · copy-settings snackbar + Undo ·
AVIF & JXL panel re-sync on copy/import · Resize "Vector" method for SVG sources
(browser-verified: SVG decodes, Vector encodes) · post-rotation
`inputWidth/Height` · 500ms delayed loading spinner · SI (base-1000) filesize
formatting.

Minor/trivial: document-title filename + hourglass · open pushes a history entry
· Back uses `history.back()` · immediate first encode · non-image-file rejection
message · drop an image anywhere (not just the dropzone) · save-side snackbar
(with try/catch) · import-side snackbar + Undo · invalid-import message + basic
validation · versioned saved
settings · 300ms reveal animations · zoom step 1.25 · download-icon rotate
animation · zoom readout width 7rem / grey · 100ms debounce · reset view on a new
same-size file.

### Also fixed (second pass)

Browser JPEG/PNG/GIF encoders + feature-detection · `contain` fitMethod
alignment · history via SvelteKit shallow routing. (See §B "Resolved".)

### Deliberate deviations / deferred (see §B)

Pinch-zoom re-fits on dimension change · WebP 2 removed entirely (2026-06-02) ·
shared decode (post-launch performance) · share-target (PWA).

Format-picker labelling (2026-06-28, intentional, differs from upstream Squoosh):
(a) JPEG XL is no longer labelled "(beta)"; (b) the picker shows plain format
names (JPEG, PNG) instead of Squoosh's encoder names (MozJPEG, OxiPNG) — the
encoder is surfaced as a hover tooltip (title attribute) instead; (c) the
"Original Image" entry no longer appends the source filename (a richer
source-image info display is planned separately).

### Deferred / N-A (see §D)

Mobile multi-panel accordion · `<two-up>` legacy `clip` fallback (modern desktop
only) · quantize "ZX" konami easter-egg (intentionally cut) · document-title
restore-on-unmount (vacuous — the route never unmounts) · share-target (B-7).

---

## D. Known-deferred (by user decision)

- **Mobile `<multi-panel>` accordion** from the original remains deferred. The
  SvelteKit editor now has a responsive lower-panel fallback instead; verify it
  before deciding whether the original accordion is still needed.
- Items above explicitly marked deferred/intentional.
