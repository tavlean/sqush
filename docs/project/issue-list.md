# Issue List

Last updated: 2026-08-08.

Small backlog seed. The big tracks live in their own plans — see
[README.md](../README.md) for the map. Product work belongs in
[roadmap.md](roadmap.md); the (concluded) migration record is in
[history/MIGRATION-PLAN.md](../history/MIGRATION-PLAN.md).

## Done

- Migration closeout verification: `npm run check`, `npm run audit`, production
  preview browser smoke, and offline-reload-after-SW-install all passed
  (2026-06-01; the archived record is in
  [history/status-archive-pre-2026-07.md](../history/status-archive-pre-2026-07.md)).
- Svelte hardening waves 0–2, 4–6 landed; Wave 3 promoted to
  [codec-options-model.md](../codec-options-model.md).

## Open

1. **WebP default method 6 is a bad trade on alpha content.** Measured
   2026-08-08 on `transparent.png`: method 6 is 50x slower than method 4 (2880ms
   vs 57ms) and produces a slightly larger file (2896 vs 2846 bytes). On photos
   the trade is fair (+25 percent time for -3 percent size). WebP is the default
   right-side encoder, so a transparent PNG drop pays ~3s for a worse result.
   Options: revert the default to method 4, or make method content-dependent.
   The default moved in `e184882f`, whose "stays sub-second" claim holds for
   photos only.
1. **Release browser coverage.** Chromium is primary; confirm Safari and Firefox
   before public support claims. Safari's nested-worker behavior specifically
   matters once threading is enabled — fold into
   [threading-enablement.md](../threading-enablement.md) verification.
2. **Browser smoke command.** If repeated local QA keeps re-running the same
   Playwright flow, capture it as a script. See [manual-qa.md](../manual-qa.md).
3. **Codec provenance gaps.** Fill any remaining gaps in
   [codec-provenance.md](../codec-provenance.md) before touching committed codec
   artifacts (the codec rebuilds in [the codec upgrade audit](reports/2026-06-02-codec-upgrade-audit.md)
   will exercise this).
4. **Turn stable backlog items into GitHub issues** if/when the project moves to
   issue-tracked work.
5. **Bulk-engine barrel pruning (AFTER Phase-3 UI wiring).** The 2026-07-10
   quality pass verified a set of `src/client/lazy-app/bulk/*` exports with no
   consumer anywhere (all re-exported via the barrel): `changes.ts` entirely
   (`applyGlobalSettings`/`applyJobOverrides`/`applyClearJobOverrides`),
   `queue.ts` internals (`updateJob`, `setJobStatus`, `getBulkJobCounterDelta`),
   `export.ts` (`getExportableJobs`, `getSelectedExportableJobs`),
   `import.ts` (`createImageJobId` + several types), `processor.ts`
   (`createBulkProcessPlan` + types), `snapshot.ts`
   (`serializeBulkSessionSnapshot` + interfaces), `strip.ts`
   (`getSelectedBulkStripItem`), `session.ts` (`getOverriddenJobs`,
   `getBatchProgress`). Deliberately NOT deleted now: Phase-3 override-UI
   wiring and the memory-ceiling design may consume some (snapshot
   serialization is designed API). Once Phase 3 lands, prune what's still
   unused.
6. **Drag-teardown micro-gaps (upstream-parity, low impact).** `Range.svelte`
   pointer-drag installs window `pointerup`/`pointercancel` listeners cleaned
   only by their own firing; `pinch-zoom.ts`/`two-up.ts` never stop their
   constructor-local PointerTrackers on disconnect (upstream Squoosh behaves
   the same). Worst case is one stray callback after a mid-drag unmount. Fix
   opportunistically if these files are touched for other reasons.
7. **`session.ts` override paths stay coarse until Phase 3.** Same-format
   overrides keep the wholesale `encoderState` alongside the sparse
   `encoderControls` companion, so `getSettingsOverridePaths` reports
   `encoderState` rather than per-control ids — intentional interim seam (the
   production UI still writes legacy full option objects); resolves with the
   WS-G UI half.
8. **`hqx` + `contain` resize crops the wrong region (correctness).** In
   `src/features/processors/resize/worker/runtime.ts` (the `fitMethod === 'contain'`
   block, ~L140), the contain-crop box is computed from the ORIGINAL source
   dimensions — `getContainOffsets(data.width, data.height, …)` — but then applied
   via `crop()` to the already hqx-upscaled `input` buffer (width = `data.width ×
   factor`). `crop` reads at the upscaled stride using original-space offsets, so it
   extracts a mangled top-left slice instead of the intended letterbox, corrupting
   the output. Only bites the niche combo `method: 'hqx'` + `fitMethod: 'contain'`
   while upscaling (hqx is a no-op at factor 1); also present in upstream Squoosh.
   Fix: pass `input.width`/`input.height` to `getContainOffsets` (or crop before
   hqx). Found in the 2026-07-21 xhigh code review.
9. **SVG auto-optimize picks by gzip but reverts by raw bytes (SVG lane).**
   `autoSearch` (`src/lib/svg/auto-search.ts`) ranks candidates by gzip transfer
   size, but `keepOriginalSvg` (`src/lib/svg/optimize.ts`, ~L28) reverts to the
   original when `optimized.rawBytes >= source.rawBytes`. A candidate that is
   smaller gzipped yet larger raw — e.g. `reusePaths`/`convertStyleToAttrs` adding
   markup that compresses well — is discarded and the panel shows 0%, so the guard's
   metric (raw) contradicts the optimizer's objective (gzip), which is also the
   headline number in the SVG size panel. Uncommon (SVGO usually shrinks both) and
   arguably a deliberate "never ship a larger file" policy, so confirm intent before
   changing. See [specs/2026-07-12-svg-optimization.md](specs/2026-07-12-svg-optimization.md).
   Found in the 2026-07-21 xhigh code review.
